  <h2 class='c006'>The Seven White Dreams of the King’s Little Daughter</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>When the Driver of the Dream Coach reached the last small
star in the sky, he unharnessed his hundred misty horses and
put them out to pasture in the great blue meadow of Heaven. It
was well he reached the end of his journey when he did, for in
another moment a mounting wave of sunlight and wind, rushing up
from the world far below, blew out the silver-white flame of the
star so that no one could follow the strange Driver and his strange
Coach to their resting place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Resting place? What a mistake! The Driver of the Dream Coach
never rests. You see, there are so many things to do even when he
is carrying no passengers. There are new dreams to invent: queer
dreams, funny dreams, fairy dreams, goblin dreams, happy dreams,
exciting dreams, short dreams, long dreams, brightly colored dreams,
and dreams made out of shadows and mist that vanish as soon as one
opens one’s eyes. Then there is the very bothersome matter of keeping
the records straight, records of those who deserve good dreams,
those who need cheering with ridiculous dreams, and those, alas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>who have been bad and naughty and have to be punished (how the
little Driver hates this!) with nightmares. It is hard to keep all
those dreams from getting mixed up, there are so many of them.
Indeed, sometimes, they do get mixed up, and a good child, who was
meant to have a dream as pretty as a pansy or as funny as a frog,
gets a nightmare by mistake. But the Driver of the Dream Coach
tries as hard as he possibly can never to let this happen. He has so
very much to do that he never would catch up with his work no
matter how quickly his beautiful horses galloped from star to star,
from world to world, if there was not some one to help him.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are little angels who help the Driver of the Dream Coach.</p>

<p class='c012'>In their gold and white book they keep a record of every one on
earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>As soon as the Driver of the Dream Coach had unharnessed his
horses he went to these angels and planned his next trip. What a
busy night it was to be! If I should use all the paper and all the
pencils in the world I could not begin to tell you about all the
dreams he arranged to carry to the sleeping world.</p>

<p class='c012'>And yet there was one child who was nearly forgotten, a little
Princess whose name had been written at the top of a new page
which the Driver had neglected to turn in his hurry.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely you are not going to forget the little Princess on her
birthday!” pleaded the little angels, turning the page.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, dear!” said the Driver. “That will never do; now, will it?
And yet—I simply can’t pack another dream into the Coach. I’m
sorry, but I’m afraid——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, dear!” echoed the angels.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Perhaps——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Just then one of the youngest angels, who happened to be leaning
over the parapet of Paradise, saw the Princess begin to cry, and
took in the situation instantly. So he hurried to the others and suggested
that he himself should carry a dream to the little Princess.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Driver of the Dream Coach thought this was a splendid idea
and thanked him again and again for his help.</p>

<p class='c012'>That is how the seven white dreams of the King’s little daughter
were carried to her by an angel, and as you know (or if you don’t,
I will tell you) the dreams carried in the moonbeam basket of the
angels are the most beautiful of all.</p>

<p class='c012'>What did the Princess dream?</p>

<p class='c012'>That you shall hear.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>I cannot remember all the names of the King’s
little daughter, and indeed few can. The Archbishop
who christened her says that he can, but he is so
great and so deaf a dignitary that no one would think
of asking him to prove it. They are all there, twelve
pages of them, in the great book where are recorded
the baptisms of all the Royal babies, so that you can
look for yourself if none of the ones I can remember—Angelica
Mary Delphine Violet Candida Pamelia
Petronella Victoire Veronica Monica Anastasia
Yvonne—happen to please you.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was the fifth birthday of the little Princess, and
there were to be great celebrations in her honor. Fireworks
would blossom in the night sky, and in the gardens
lanterns were hung like bubbles of colored light
from white rose tree to red, while the great fountains
would turn from pink to mauve, from mauve to azure,
to amber, and to green, as they flung up slender stems
and great spreading lacy fronds of water. Every one
from the King down to the smallest kitchen-maid had
new clothes for the occasion, and the Chief Cook had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>created a birthday cake iced with fairy grottoes and
gardens of spun sugar, so huge and so heavy that the
Princess’s ten pages in their new sky-blue and silver
liveries, staggered under the weight of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little Princess had a new gown of white satin,
sewn so thickly with pearls that it was perfectly stiff,
and stood as well without her as when she was inside
it. It was standing by her bedside when the bells of
the city awoke her on her birthday morning, together
with her silver bath shaped like a great shell, and her
nine lace petticoats, and her hoops to go over the petticoats,
and her little white slippers on a cushion of
cloth-of-silver, and her whalebone stays, and her cobweb
stockings, and her ten Ladies-In-Waiting, Grand
Duchesses every one. When she opened her blue eyes
they all swept her the deepest curtsies, their skirts of
bright brocade billowing up about them, and said
together:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Long Life and Happiness to Your Serene Highness!”
and then the first Grand Duchess popped her out
of bed and into her bath, where she got a great deal of
soap in the Princess’s eyes while she conversed in a
most respectful and edifying manner.</p>

<p class='c012'>The second Grand Duchess, who was Lady-In-Waiting-In-Charge-Of-The-Imperial-Towel,
was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>even more respectful, and nearly rubbed the Princess’s
tiny button of a nose entirely off her face.</p>

<p class='c012'>The third Grand Duchess brushed and combed the
little duck tails of yellow silk that covered the Royal
head; and <i>oh</i>, how she did pull!</p>

<p class='c012'>The fourth Grand Duchess was Lady-In-Waiting-In-Charge-Of-The-Imperial-Shift,
and as she was
rather old and slow, although extremely noble, the
Princess grew cold indeed before the shift covered up
her little pink body.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fifth Grand Duchess put on the rigid stays.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sixth put on the stockings and slippers.</p>

<p class='c012'>The seventh was very important and gave herself
airs, for the nine lace petticoats were her concern.</p>

<p class='c012'>The eighth Grand Duchess was Lady-In-Waiting-In-Charge-Of-The-Imperial-Hoops.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ninth put on the little Princess the dress of satin
and pearls, that glowed softly like moonlit drops of
water.</p>

<p class='c012'>And the tenth Grand Duchess, the oldest and ugliest
and noblest and crossest and most respectful of them
all, placed on the yellow head the little frosty crown
of diamonds.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the Princess’s Father Confessor, a very noble
Prince of the Church, dressed in violet from top to toe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>came in between two little boys in lace, and said a long
prayer in Latin. It was so long that, I am sorry to have
to tell you, right in the middle the Princess yawned,
so of course another long prayer had to be said to ask
Heaven to overlook such shocking wickedness on the
part of Her Highness.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the Chief-Steward-In-Attendance-On-The-Princess
brought her breakfast—bread and milk in a
silver porringer. The little Princess had hoped for
strawberries, as it was her birthday, but the Chief Gardener
was saving every strawberry in the Royal gardens
for the great Birthday Banquet that was to be held
that evening.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the little Princess went to say good morning
to her Mother and Father, and this is the way she
went.</p>

<p class='c012'>First came two heralds in forest green, blowing on
silver trumpets. Then came the Father Confessor and
his little lace-covered boys. Then came the Ladies-In-Waiting
in their bright brocades, with feathers in their
powdered hair, and after each lady came a little black
page to carry her handkerchief on a satin cushion. The
ten pages of the Princess were next, and after them
came the Royal Baby’s Own Regiment of Dragoons in
white and scarlet. And last came four gigantic blacks
wearing white loin cloths and enormous turbans of
flamingo pink, and carrying a great canopy of cloth-of-silver
fringed with pearls, and under this, very tiny,
and looking, in her spreading gown, like a little white
hollyhock out for a walk, came the Princess.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
<img src='images/i_017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>The nine lace petticoats were her concern.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>After she had curtsied, and kissed the hands of her
Royal parents, her Father gave her a rope of milk-white
pearls and her Mother gave her a ruby as big as
a pigeon’s egg, both of which were instantly locked
up in the Royal treasury. They then bestowed upon
her, in addition to her other titles, that of Grand
Duchess of Pinchpinchowitz, which took so long to do
that when she had said thank you it was time for lunch,
which was just the same as breakfast, except that this
time the porringer was gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>After lunch the Prime Minister read the Princess
an illuminated Birthday Greeting from her loyal subjects,
which ran along so that the Ladies-In-Waiting
nearly yawned their heads off behind their painted
fans, and the Princess had a nice little nap, and
dreamed that there would be strawberries for supper.</p>

<p class='c012'>But instead there was bread and milk in a porringer
covered with turquoises and moonstones.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, as the younger Ladies-In-Waiting were thinking
of the Gentlemen-Of-The-Court who would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>waiting for them among the rose trees and yew hedges,
to watch the colored water of the fountains and listen
to the harps and flutes, and as the older Ladies-In-Waiting
were thinking of comfortable seats out of a
draught in the State Ball Room, and having the choicest
morsels of roasted peacock and larks’ tongue pie
and frozen nectarines, they popped the Princess into
bed pretty promptly—indeed, an hour earlier than
usual—and went off to celebrate her birthday.</p>

<p class='c012'>The room in which the little Princess lay was as big
as a church, and the great bed was as big as a chapel.
Four carved posts as tall as palm trees in a tropic jungle,
held a canopy of needlework where hunters rode
and hounds gave chase and deer fled through dark
forests. Below this lay the broad smooth expanse of
silken sheet and counterpane, and in the midst, as little
and alone as a bird in an empty sky, lay the King’s little
daughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>One large tear rolled down her round pink cheek,
and then another. The long dull day had tired her,
and the great dim room frightened her, and she wanted
to see the fireworks she had heard her pages whispering
about. She sat up among her lace pillows, and her
tears went splash, splash, on the embroidered flowers
and leaves of her coverlet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
<img src='images/i_021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>One of the youngest angels happened to be leaning
over the parapet of Paradise when the Princess began
to cry, and he took in the situation instantly, and hurried
off to his Heavenly playmates to tell them about
it. “It is her birthday,” he said, “and no one has given
her as much as a red apple or a white rose—only silly
old rubies and pearls that she wasn’t even allowed to
play marbles with! And now they have left her to
weep in the dark while they dance and feast! I shall
go down to her and sit by her bed till her tears are dry,
and take her a white dream as a gift.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, let me send a dream too!” cried another angel.
“And let me!” “And let me!” So that by the time the
little angel was ready to start to earth there were seven
white dreams to be taken as birthday gifts from
Heaven, and he had to weave a basket of moonbeams
to carry them in.</p>

<p class='c013'>That night the Princess dreamed that she was a daisy
in a field, dancing delicately in the wind among other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>daisies as thick as the stars in the Milky Way. Feathery
grasses danced with them, and yellow butterflies danced
above, and the larks in the sky flung down cascades of
lovely notes that scattered like spray on the joyous
wind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some poor little girls were playing in the field. Their
feet were bare and their faded frocks were torn, but
they danced and sang too. There came a rumbling like
thunder, and through a gap in the hawthorn hedge the
children and the daisies saw the King’s little daughter
driven past in her great scarlet coach drawn by eight
dappled horses. They could see the little Princess sitting
up very straight with her crinoline puffing about
her and her crown on her head, and after she had
passed all the children played that they were princesses,
making daisy crowns for their heads, and hoops
of brier boughs to hold out their limp little petticoats.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>The next day the Princess looked in vain for a daisy
as she took her morning constitutional in the Royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>gardens. There were roses and lilies, blue irises, and
striped red and yellow carnations tied to stakes, all
stiff and straight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hold up your head, Serene Highness!” snapped
one of the Ladies-In-Waiting, who had had too many
cherry tarts at too late an hour the night before.</p>

<p class='c012'>But daisies danced in the Princess’s heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next night the Princess dreamed that she was
a little white cloud afloat in the bright blue sky. She
floated over the blue sea and the white sand, and over
black forests of whispering pines, and over a land
where fields of tulips bloomed for miles, in squares of
lovely colors, delicate rose and mauve and purple, coppery
pink and creamy yellow, with canals running
through them like strips of old, dark looking-glass. She
floated over rye fields turning silver in the wind, and
over nuns at work in their walled gardens, and finally
over a great grim palace where a King’s little daughter
lived. “I would rather be free and afloat in the sky,”
thought the small white cloud.</p>

<p class='c013'>When she took the air the next day, she looked up to
see if any white clouds were in the sky. “Her Highness
is growing very proud,” said the Ladies-In-Waiting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“She holds her nose up in the air as a King’s
daughter should.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_024a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>On the third night, the Princess dreamed she was
a little lamb skipping and nibbling the new green grass
in a meadow where hundreds of lilies of the valley
were in bloom. They were still wet and sparkling with
rain, but now the sun shone and a beautiful rainbow
arched above the meadow and the lilies of the valley
and the happy little lamb.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_024b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>Through the rest of her life the gentleness of the
lamb lay in the heart of the Princess.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next night she dreamed that she was a white
butterfly drifting with other butterflies among the tree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>ferns and orchids of the jungle, gentle and safe from
harm, although serpents lay among the branches of the
trees and lions and tigers roamed through the green
shadows.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>A white butterfly flew in at her window the next day.
“A moth! A moth!” cried the Ladies-In-Waiting.
“Camphor and boughs of cedar must be procured
instantly, or the dreadful creature will eat up Her
Highness’s ermine robes!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But the little Princess knew better than that.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the fifth night she dreamed that she was a tiny
white egg lying in a nest that a humming bird had hung
to a spray of fern by a rope of twisted spider’s web.
The nest was softly and warmly lined with silky down,
and above her was the soft warmth of the mother bird’s
breast.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
<img src='images/i_026a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>On the sixth night she was a snowflake. It was Christmas
night, and the towns and villages were gay. Rosy
light poured from every window, blurred by the falling
snow, and the air was full of the sound of bells.
High up on the mountain was a lonely wayside shrine
with carved and painted wooden figures of the Mother
and Her Child whose Birthday it was. There were no
bells there, nor yellow candle light, but only snow
and dark evergreen trees. The snowflake, whirling
and dancing down from the sky, a tiny frosty star, gave
its life as a birthday gift to the Holy Child, lying for
its little moment in His outstretched hand.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_026b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>The angel was distressed to find, on the seventh
night, that the seventh dream had slipped through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>hole in the moonbeam basket and was lost. Careless
little angel! But it really did not matter, for instead
of a dream, he showed himself to the Princess. And
she liked that the best of all, for she had never had
any one to play with before, and there is no playmate
equal to an angel. But the seventh dream is still drifting
about the world—I wonder where? Perhaps it
will be upon my pillow to-night—perhaps upon yours.
Who knows?</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Goran’s Dream</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Crack! went the Driver’s whip, but it did not hurt the galloping
misty horses, for it was only a ribbon of rainbow that he
liked to use because both he and his horses thought it so pretty.
And away went the great Coach, over the forests and over the seas,
over the cities and plains, to a country where the sea thrusts long
silver fingers into the land, where mountains are white with snow
at the same time that the meadows are bright with wild flowers,
and where in summer the sun never sets, and in winter it never
rises. And here the Dream Coach drew up beside a cottage where a
lonely little Norwegian boy was falling asleep.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, Goran!” called the Driver. “Come, climb into the Coach
and find the dream I have brought for you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Who was Goran? What dream did he find?</p>

<p class='c012'>That you shall hear.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span></div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>
Little Goran and his grandmother lived in a tiny
house in Norway, high above the deep waters of a
fjord. When Goran was a baby they used to tie one
end of a rope around his waist and the other to the
door, so that if he toddled over the edge he could be
hauled back like a fish on a line. But now he was no
longer a baby, but a big boy, six years old, and he tried
to take care of his grandmother as a big boy should.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a lovely spot in summer, when the waterfalls
went pouring down milk-white into the green fjord,
sending up so much spray that they looked as if they
were steaming hot; when rainbows hung in the sky;
when the small steep meadows were bright with wild
flowers, and even the sod roof of the cottage was like
a little wild garden of harebells and pansies and strawberries
that Goran gathered for breakfast sometimes.
He was happy all day then, fishing in the fjord, making
a little cart for Nanna, the goat, to pull, trying to teach
Gustava, the hen, to sing, putting on his fingers the pink
and purple hats that he picked from the tall spires of
wild foxglove and monkshood, and making them dance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and bow, and listening to the loud music of the waterfalls
after rain.</p>

<p class='c012'>And in the evening after supper Goran’s grandmother
would tell him splendid stories while they sat
together in the doorway making straw beehives, sewing
the rounds of straw together with split blackberry
briers. The sun would shine on the straw and make it
look so yellow and glistening that Goran would pretend
he was making a golden beehive for the Queen
Bee’s palace. For where Goran lived the sun never sets
at all in the middle of summer, and it is bright daylight
not only all day, but all night as well. You and I would
never have known when to go to bed, but Goran and
his grandmother were used to it, and even Gustava, the
hen, knew enough to put her head under her wing and
make her own dark night.</p>

<p class='c012'>But with winter, changes came. The flowers slept
under the earth until spring’s call should wake them,
and yawning and stretching, <i>s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g</i>, they
should stretch up into the air and sunlight. The waterfalls
no longer flung up clouds of spray like smoke,
but built roofs of ice over themselves. And, strangest
of all, the winter darkness came, so that the days were
like the nights, and you and I would never have known
when to get up.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“I must go to the village for our winter supplies
before the snow falls and cuts us off,” his grandmother
said to Goran one day. “Neighbor Skylstad has offered
me a seat in his rowboat to-morrow, and will bring me
back the next day. You won’t be afraid to stay here
alone, will you, Goran?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, Grandmother,” said Goran. He pretended to
be tremendously interested in poking his finger into
the earth in a geranium pot, so that his grandmother
shouldn’t see that his eyes were full of tears and his
lower lip was trembling. For to tell you the truth he
was frightened. The little house was so far from
any other house, and then Goran had never spent a
night alone. Last year when the winter’s supplies were
bought, he had gone to the village with his grandfather,
and he had told Nanna and Gustava and Mejau,
the cat, all about what a wonderful place it was, a
thousand times over; the warm shop, with its great
cheeses in wooden boxes painted with bright birds and
flowers, and its glowing stove, as tall and slim as a
proud lady in a black dress, with a wreath of iron ferns
upon her head; the other children who had let him play
with them while grandfather exchanged the socks and
mittens knitted by grandmother for potatoes and
candles. And they had slept at the inn under a feather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>bed so heavy that you would have thought by morning
they would have been pressed as flat as the flowers in
grandmother’s big Bible. But they weren’t! They
got up just as round as ever, and had a wonderful
breakfast of dark grayish-brown goats’-milk cheese,
cold herring, and stewed bilberries. Grandfather had
gone to Heaven since then, and Goran wondered if
he could possibly be finding it as delightful as the
village.</p>

<p class='c012'>How he did want to go this time! But of course he
knew that some one must stay behind to feed Nanna
and Gustava and Mejau, to tend the fire and water the
geraniums and wind the clock. So he said as bravely
as he could: “I’ll take care of everything, Grandmother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after his grandmother left, the snow began to
fall. How that frightened Goran! Suppose it snowed
so hard that she could never get back to him! For when
winter really began, the little house was often up to
its chimney in snow, and they could get to no one, and
no one could get to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>How poor little Goran’s heart began to hammer at
the thought! He fell to work to make himself forget
the snow. First, seizing a broom made of a bundle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>twigs, he swept the hard earth floor, which in summer
had so pretty a carpet of green leaves, strewn fresh
every day by Goran and his grandmother. Then he
poured some water on the geraniums in the window,
only spilling a little on himself. Then he stroked
Mejau, who was purring loudly in front of the fire;
and all this made him feel much better.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time for dinner, Goran!” said the old clock on
the wall. At least it said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!” which meant the
same thing.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Goran ate the goats’-milk cheese and black bread
that his grandmother had left for him; and then, and
not before, he summoned up enough courage to look
out to see if the snow was still falling.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was snowing harder than ever, and already everything
had a deep fluffy covering. Oh, would his grandmother
ever be able to get back to him? But he must
be brave, and not cry, for he was six years old. He
said a little prayer, as his grandmother had taught
him to do whenever he was frightened or unhappy,
and his heavy heart grew lighter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll make a snowman,” Goran decided. Perhaps
then the time would seem shorter. Grandfather and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>he had made a splendid snowman after the first snowfall
last winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was not late enough in the year to have the day
as dark as night. It was only as dark as a deep winter
twilight, and the white snow seemed to give out a light
of its own for Goran to work by.</p>

<p class='c012'>First he found an old broomstick and thrust it into
the snow so that it stood upright. Then he pushed the
heavy wet snow around it, patting on here, scooping
out there, until there was a body to hold the big snowball
he rolled for the head. A bent twig pressed in
made a pleasant smile, and for eyes Goran ran indoors
and took from the little box that held his treasures two
marbles of sky-blue glass that his grandfather had
given him once for his birthday.</p>

<p class='c012'>What a beautiful snowman! With his sky-blue eyes
he gazed through the falling snow at little Goran.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!” called the old
clock, and that was the same as saying:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time for supper, Goran!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The fire lit up the room with a warm glow, painted
the curtains crimson, and made wavering gigantic
shadows on the walls. The water bubbled in the pot,
and the boiling potatoes knocked against the lid.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“Prr-prrr!” said Mejau, blinking in front of the blaze,
and the old clock answered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tock! Tick! Tock!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Goran had given their supper to Nanna and Gustava
and Mejau, and had taken one good-night look
at his snowman. Now he put his bowl of boiled
potatoes on the table in front of the fire, and pulled
up his chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lying on the floor where she had fallen from his
box when he was getting his snowman’s blue eyes was
a playing card, the Queen of Clubs. His grandfather
had found it lying in the road in the village, and had
brought it home as a present for Goran. The little boy
thought the Queen was very splendid, with her crown
and her veil, and her red dress trimmed with bands of
blue and leaves and stars and rising suns of yellow. In
one hand she held on high a little yellow flower. Now
he picked her up and put her on a chair beside him,
pretending the Queen had come for supper to keep
him from being lonely. Each mouthful of potato he
first offered her, with great politeness, but the delicate
lady only gazed off into space.</p>

<p class='c012'>Goran’s supper made his insides feel as if a soft
blanket had been tucked cozily about them, and he was
warm and sleepy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Was there anything else Grandmother told me to
do before I went to bed?” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tick! Tock! Yes, there was,” the Clock replied.
“She told you to wind me up. Climb on a chair and do
it carefully. Don’t shake me. I can’t stand that, for
I’m not as young as I used to be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I want a drink!” cried the youngest geranium,
who was little, and had been hidden by the bigger pots
when Goran watered them.</p>

<p class='c012'><i>Knock, knock, knock!</i></p>

<p class='c012'>What a knocking at the door! Goran ran to open it,
and the firelight fell on Nanna the Goat and Gustava
the Hen against a background of whirling snow. Nanna
was wearing Grandmother’s quilted jacket—where in
the world had she found that? And Gustava had
wrapped Goran’s muffler about herself and the little
basket she carried on her wing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good evening!” began Nanna, rather timidly for
her. “May Gustava and I come in and sit by the fire?
We thought you might be lonely, and then it is so cold
in the shed. I did have a muffler like Gustava’s, but
I absent-mindedly ate it. I’m growing <i>very</i> absent-minded.
We’ve come with an important message
for you, but I can’t remember what it is. Can you,
Gustava?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Cluck! Clu-uck! No, I can’t. But I’ve brought
my beautiful child to call on you,” said Gustava; and
she lifted her wing and showed Goran the brown egg
in her basket.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shut the door! Shut the door!” several Geraniums
called indignantly. “We are very delicate, and we
shall catch our deaths of cold!”</p>

<p class='c012'>So in came Nanna and Gustava and Gustava’s Egg,
and Goran shut the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Present my subjects!” commanded the Queen of
Clubs, and Goran saw that she was no longer a little
card, but a lady as big as his grandmother. In front
she still wore her blue and red and yellow dress, but
in back she was all blue, every inch of her, with a pattern
of gilt stars, and when she turned sideways she
seemed to vanish, for she was only as thick as cardboard.
But she was so proud and grand that Goran
wished he had on his Sunday suit, with the long black
trousers and the short black jacket with its big silver
buttons, the waistcoat all covered with needlework
flowers, and the raspberry pink neckerchief.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is Nanna, our Goat, your Majesty,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goat, you may kiss my hand,” said the Queen.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know whether I want to,” replied rude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Nanna, who had never been presented to a Queen
before, and didn’t know the proper way to behave.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mercy on us! What manners!” cried the Geraniums,
blushing deep red that the Queen should be
spoken to in that manner, in what they thought of as
<i>their</i> house.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I wouldn’t mind eating your yellow flower,”
continued Nanna. “I like to eat flowers.” And she
looked at the Geraniums, who nearly fainted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your turn next,” said the Queen to Gustava. She
had heard gentlemen say that so often when they were
playing <i>Skat</i> with her and her companions that she
always repeated it when she could think of nothing
else to say.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Squawk! Cluck!” cried Gustava. “Would your
Majesty like to see my beautiful child?” and she
showed the Queen her Egg. “Just look, your Majesty!
Have you ever seen anything more lovely? Such a
pale brown color! Such an innocent expression! Perhaps
your Majesty is also a mother?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tick! Tock! Don’t forget to wind me!” said the
old Clock.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>
<img src='images/i_041.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>This is Nanna, our Goat, your Majesty.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Gustava Hen talks too much,” the fat Teapot in
the corner cupboard told her daughters the Teacups.
“When the Queen speaks to <i>you</i>, just say ‘Yes, your
Majesty,’ and ‘No, your Majesty,’ and I dare say she
will take you all to Court and find you handsome husbands
among the Royal Coffeecups.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Your Majesty should see my beautiful home,” went
on Gustava. “A nest of pure gold!” (She thought it
was gold, but it was really yellow straw.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just like my throne,” replied the Queen. “Speaking
of beautiful homes, you <i>should</i> see my Palace!
There are fifty-three rooms!” (She said this because
it was the highest number she knew, for there are fifty-three
cards in the pack, counting the Joker who keeps
all the cards amused when they are shut up in their
box. And she had seen a room in the Palace, because
she had been used in a game of <i>Skat</i> there, once in her
early youth. But that was long, long ago.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“My throne and the King’s throne are pure gold,
just like your nest, my good Gustava. And the walls
are painted red and white, in swirls, like strawberries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>and cream. The stove has such a tall slender figure,
and wears a golden crown. And then, just imagine, all
the lamps are dripping with icicles at the same time
that the floor is covered with blooming roses!” (For
that is how she thought of the glass lusters on the lamps
and the carpet on the floor.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“Icicles! Ice! Freezing! <i>That</i> reminds me of our
important message!” cried Nanna. “Your Snowman,
Goran. He looks so dreadfully cold out there, we were
afraid he would perish.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, yes! How could we have forgotten for so long!
Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! He will certainly be frozen
to death unless something is done quickly!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do you mean to tell me that any one is out of doors
on such a night as this?” questioned the Queen. “Have
him brought in at once! Your turn next!” And she
looked so severely at Goran that he felt his ears getting
red.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Goran and Nanna brought the Snowman in,
while the Queen gave orders from the doorway, Gustava
sat on her darling Egg to keep it warm, Mejau
walked away with his tail as big as a bottle brush, and
the Geraniums cried in chorus:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shut the door! Shut the door! We shall all catch
cold!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
<img src='images/i_045.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>The Queen and the Snowman.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Poor thing! How pale he is!” exclaimed the
Queen. “And how dreadfully cold! Put him in a
chair by the fire!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The Snowman looked out of wondering sky-blue
glass eyes, but said never a word, for he was very shy;
and as he had only been born that afternoon, everything
in the world was new to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I want a drink!” cried the youngest Geranium;
and: “Tick! Tock! Tick! Don’t forget to wind me!”
the old Clock repeated; but no one paid any attention
to them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your turn next!” said the Queen to Nanna. “Make
a blaze, for this poor creature is nearly frozen.” So
with a clatter of tiny hoofs, Nanna built up the fire,
only pausing to eat a twig or two, until even Mejau
was nearly roasted.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the poor Snowman was worse instead of better.
His twig mouth still smiled bravely, and his blue eyes
remained wide open, but tears seemed to pour down
his cheeks, and he was growing thinner before their
very eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you please,” he said in a timid voice, “I’m——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Give him a drink of something hot,” advised the
fat Teapot, and that reminded the youngest Geranium,
who began screaming:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“I want a drink! I want a drink! I want a drink!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_048.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be delighted to oblige with some nice warm
milk,” Nanna offered, so Goran milked a bowlful. But
the Snowman could not drink it, and the tears ran
faster and faster down his face.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you please——” he began again, faintly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must put him to bed,” the Queen interrupted,
with a stern look at Gustava who was sitting on her
darling Egg in the center of Grandmother’s feather
bed. “Your turn next!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Grandmother’s bed was built into the wall, like a
cupboard. It was all carved with harebells and pinecones
and kobolds and nixies. The kobolds are the
elves who live in the mountain forests, and the nixies
are water fairies who sit under the waterfalls playing
upon their harps and making the sweetest music in the
world. There was a big white feather bed on Grandmother’s
bed, and a big red feather bed on top of that,
and two fat pillows stuffed with goose feathers. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>above all this was a little shelf with two smaller feather
beds and two smaller pillows, and that was Goran’s
bed. On dreadfully cold nights they pulled two little
wooden doors shut, and there they were, quite warm
and cozy—even quite stuffy, you and I might think!
The doors of the bed were painted with pink tulips
and red hearts, and Grandmother said it made her feel
quite young and warm to look at them, and Goran said
it made him feel quite young and warm too. And
Gustava the Hen thought they were beautiful, so there
she sat on her darling Egg, and as she could never
think of more than one thing at a time, she had forgotten
all about the Snowman, and was happily clucking
this song to her Egg:</p>

      <div class='line'>For Gustava’s Egg,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>broke in Nanna the Goat impatiently:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Why leave the Geraniums out?</div>
      <div class='line'>Add the Teapot’s broken spout,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cheese, and brown potatoes, too;</div>
      <div class='line'>Anything at all will do.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Feathers from the feather bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Goran’s mittens, warm and red,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the flower the Queen holds up,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the cracked blue china cup.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But the Queen has said</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Kindly leave that bed!</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>So Gustava had to flop off the bed with a squawk,
while Goran handed her her Egg, and then they put
the poor Snowman, what was left of him, into Grandmother’s
bed, and pulled the eiderdown quilts over
him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If you please,” said the Snowman in a feeble
whisper, “oh, if you <i>please</i>, I’m——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know this is the right thing to do, because it is
the way we always treat Snowmen at the Palace,” broke
in the Queen. To tell you the truth, she had never seen
a Snowman in her life before, but she would never
admit that she didn’t know all about everything.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The Snowman looked at them with despairing sky-blue
eyes, while his tears poured down, soaking Grandmother’s
pillow. He had tried desperately to tell them
something, but they would none of them listen. Suddenly
Goran knew what it was.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe we’re melting him,” said Goran. “He
needs air.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I need air,” said the Snowman, his face shining
with hope.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Air?</i>” said the Queen. “Nonsense! He’s had too
much air. He needs a hot brick at his feet!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I need air,” faltered the Snowman.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Air?</i> Nonsense!” cried the fat Teapot and all her
Teacup daughters, hoping the Queen would hear, and
take them back to the Palace with her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I need air,” sighed the Snowman, and now he
looked discouraged.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Air? Brrr-rrr!” And Mejau squeezed himself
under the chest of drawers, much annoyed with every
one.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I need air,” breathed the Snowman, looking at
Goran with imploring eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Air?</i> Mercy on us, that will mean opening the
door again!” And the Geraniums shivered in every
leaf and petal.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>But Goran had helped the poor Snowman, now
nearly melted away, out of bed, and was leading him
to the door.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I need——” whispered the Snowman, and his voice
was so faint that Goran could hardly hear it.</p>

<p class='c012'>And there, because he was melting away so fast, his
mouth fell out and lay on the floor, just a little bent
twig.</p>

<p class='c012'>Poor Snowman! Oh, poor Snowman! He could
not make a sound now—he could only look at them, so
sadly, so sadly!</p>

<p class='c012'>But a little Mouse peeping with bright eyes out of
its hole saw what had happened, and, since Mejau was
nowhere in sight, ventured to squeak:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, please, Ma’am! Oh, please, Sir! The poor
gentleman’s mouth is lying on the floor!”</p>

<p class='c012'>So the Queen picked it up and pressed it into place
again, but by mistake she put it on wrong side up, so
that instead of a pleasant smile the Snowman had the
crossest mouth in the world, pulled far down at each
corner.</p>

<p class='c012'>And what a change it made in him!</p>

<p class='c012'>Before, his voice had been a gentle whisper—now it
was an angry bellow that made the Teacups shiver on
their shelf and the Geraniums turn quite pale, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>little Mouse dive back with a squeak into her hole,
thinking to herself: “Well, I <i>never</i>!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here, you!” shouted the Snowman. “Get me out
of here, and get me out quick. Hop along, my girl,
and open the door! Your turn next!” (This was to
the astonished Queen.) “Now, then, carry me out!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tick! Tock! I’m feeling dreadfully run down,”
said the old Clock.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tick! Tock!</div>
      <div class='line'>Wind the Clock!</div>
      <div class='line'>Tock! Tick!</div>
      <div class='line'>Wind it quick!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Tick—Tock——” and he stopped talking.</p>

<p class='c012'>The astonished Queen meekly threw open the door,
and Goran carried the Snowman into the snowy darkness.
Brr-rr! It was bitter cold!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now bring some snow and build me up,” the Snowman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>ordered. “Leave the door open so that you can
see—don’t dawdle!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The firelight from the open door shone on his blue
glass eyes, and made two angry red sparks gleam in
them. Goran and the Queen, Gustava and Nanna,
scooped up handfuls and hoof-fuls and wing-fuls of
newly fallen snow, and patted it on to the Snowman
until he stuck out his chest more proudly than he had
done in the first place, and he was so fat that he looked
as if he were wearing six white fur coats, one on top of
another. And all the time when he wasn’t frightening
the Queen half out of her wits by shouting: “Your
turn next!” he kept muttering away to himself:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Melt me over the fire! Smother me in a feather
bed! Put a hot brick at my feet!”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was when Goran was patting a little fresh snow
on the Snowman’s nose that he accidentally knocked
his twig mouth off again. And this time it was put
back right side up, so that the Snowman was as smiling
as he had been in the beginning.</p>

<p class='c012'>He stopped roaring. He stopped muttering. Did
the fire die down? For the red sparks no longer
gleamed in his gentle sky-blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, thank you so much!” said the Snowman. “You
have been so kind to me! And I know that you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>trying to help me in the house. Forgive me for having
been so cross! Will you please forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>And the Snowman looked so anxiously at Goran
and the Queen and Nanna and Gustava that they all
answered:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes, of course we will! And will you please
forgive <i>us</i> for nearly melting you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now go in, for this lovely air is cold for you,
I know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, it is bitter cold!” agreed the Queen. “Brr-rrr!
It is bitter cold.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Brr-rr! It was bitter cold!</p>

<p class='c013'>Goran rubbed his eyes. Only a few red embers
glowed in the fireplace. How stiff he was!</p>

<p class='c012'>He must have slept in his chair all night, but he
could not tell how late it was, for the Clock had
stopped. He had forgotten to wind it, he remembered
now.</p>

<p class='c012'>There sat the Queen in her chair, but she was just
a little card again.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then he remembered the Snowman. He ran out of
doors.</p>

<p class='c012'>There the Snowman stood, as roly-poly as ever, with
his twig mouth smiling and his sky-blue eyes wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>open. He said nothing, but Goran felt they two understood
each other.</p>

<p class='c012'>What a night it had been! Could it all have been
a dream? But now the night was over, and the storm
was over; and, best of all, through the dim twilight he
saw on the fjord far below him Neighbor Skylstad’s
rowboat, and seated in it, wrapped in her red shawl,
his own dear grandmother coming home to him.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>The Driver of the Dream Coach paused as he turned over the
pages of the great white and gold book in which are kept the
names of all those who have ridden or are to be given rides in the
brightly painted Coach.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see,” he said, addressing the little angels who helped him keep
these records, “I see the name of the Little Chinese Emperor. And
there is a cross opposite his name. Has he been naughty?” he asked.
“Has he been picking the sacred lotus flowers of his honorable
ancestors? Has he——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, please,” interrupted one of the smallest angels, “I put that
cross there to remind me to tell you something about the Little
Emperor. You see he hasn’t been naughty—not exactly—but he’s
made a mistake. He doesn’t understand,” said the smallest angel,
with his eyes round and serious.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And can I help the Little Emperor understand?” asked the
Driver of the Dream Coach.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course you can!” cried the smallest angel, beaming brightly.
“It’s this way. The Little Chinese Emperor has a friend of mine
fastened up in a cage, where he is very sad——”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“An angel in a cage?” asked the Driver. “I never heard of such
a thing!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, not exactly an angel, a——”</p>

<p class='c012'>But what it was, and how the Driver helped the little angel’s
friend——</p>

<p class='c012'>That you shall hear.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>
The Little Emperor was dreadfully bored.
He yawned so that his round little face, as round
and yellow as a full moon, grew quite long, and his
nose wrinkled up into soft yellow creases, like cream
that is being pushed back by the skimmer from the top
of a bowl of milk. His slanting black eyes shut up
tight, and when they opened they were so full of tears
that they sparkled like blackthorn berries wet with rain.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried his aunt, Princess
Autumn Cloud. “The Little Emperor is bored! What
shall we do, oh, what shall we do to amuse him? For
when he is bored, he very soon grows naughty, and
when he is naughty—oh, <i>dear</i>!”</p>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_061.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>And she began to cry. But then she was always
crying. When she was born her father and mother
named her Bright Yellow Butterfly Floating In The
Sunshine, but she cried so much that by the time she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>was five years old they saw that name wouldn’t do at
all, and changed it to Autumn Cloud Pouring Down
Rain Upon The Sad Gray Sea.</p>

<p class='c012'>She cried about anything. If her Lady-In-Waiting
brought her a bowl of tea with honeysuckle blossoms in
it, she would cry because they weren’t jasmine flowers.
If they were jasmine, she would cry because they
weren’t honeysuckle. When the peach trees bloomed
she would cry because that meant that spring had
come, and that meant summer would soon follow,
and then autumn, and then the cold winter. “And oh,
how cold the wind will be then, and how fast the
snow will fall!” sobbed Princess Autumn Cloud,
looking through her tears at the bright pink peach
blossoms.</p>

<p class='c012'>She cried because her sea-green jacket was embroidered
with storks instead of bamboo trees.</p>

<p class='c012'>She cried because they brought her shark-fin soup in
a bowl of green lacquer with a gold dragon twisting
around it, instead of a red lacquer bowl with a silver
dragon.</p>

<p class='c012'>She cried if the weather was hot.</p>

<p class='c012'>She cried if the weather was cold.</p>

<p class='c012'>And hardest of all she cried whenever the Little
Emperor was naughty.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Whenever she began to cry a Lady-In-Waiting knelt
in front of her and caught her tears in a golden bowl,
for it never would have done to let them run down her
cheeks, like an ordinary person’s tears; they would
have washed such deep roads through the thick white
powder on her face. Every morning Princess Autumn
Cloud (and, indeed, every lady in the Court of the
Little Emperor) covered her face with honey in which
white jasmine petals had been crushed to make it
smell sweet, then when she was all sticky she put on
powder until her face was as white as an egg. Then
she painted on very surprised-looking black eyebrows
and a little mouth as red and round as a blob of sealing
wax. It looked just as if her mouth were an important
letter that had to be sealed up to keep all sorts
of secrets from escaping. Princess Autumn Cloud and
Princess Gentle Breeze and Lady Gleaming Dragon
Fly and Lady Moon Seen Through The Mist and all
the rest of them would have thought it as shocking to
appear without paint and powder covering up their
faces as they would have thought it to appear without
any clothes.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Princess Autumn Cloud leaned over as if she
were making a deep bow, and let her tears fall in a
golden bowl, and then, because they were Royal tears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>they were poured into beautiful porcelain bottles that
were sealed up and placed, rows and rows and rows of
them, in a room all hung with silk curtains embroidered
with weeping willows.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, <i>what</i> shall be done to amuse the Little Emperor?”
sobbed Princess Autumn Cloud. “Perhaps
he would like some music!” And she clapped her hands,
with their long, long fingernails covered with gold
fingernail protectors.</p>

<p class='c012'>So four fat musicians, dressed in vermilion silk and
wearing big horn-rimmed spectacles to show how wise
they were, came and kowtowed to the Little Emperor.
That is, they got down on their knees, which was hard
for them to do because they were so fat, and then, all
together, knocked their heads on the floor nine times
apiece to show their deep respect.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then one beat on a drum, boom boom, and one
clashed cymbals of brass together, crash <i>bang</i>, and one
rang little bells of green and milk-white jade, and the
oldest and fattest beat with mallets up and down the
back of a musical instrument carved and painted to
look like a life-sized tiger with glaring eyes and sharp
white teeth.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Little Emperor sprawled back in his big dragon
throne under the softly waving peacock feather fans,
stretched out his arms and legs, and yawned harder
than ever.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>Four fat Chinese musicians.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Oh! Oh! Oh! <i>What</i> shall be done to amuse him?”
wailed Princess Autumn Cloud, bursting into tears
afresh. “Can <i>no</i> one suggest anything?”</p>

<p class='c012'>And although the Mandarins and the Court Ladies
thought to themselves that what they would really like
to suggest for such a spoiled little boy would be to
send him to bed without his supper, they none of
them dared say so, but tried to look very solemn and
sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Would the Little Old Ancestor enjoy some sweetmeats?”
suggested Lady Lotus Blossom. “Old Ancestor”
is what you call the Emperor if you are properly
brought up, <i>and</i> polite, <i>and</i> Chinese.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Gentlemen-In-Waiting came and kowtowed and
offered the Little Emperor lacquered boxes of crystallized
ginger, of sugared sunflower seeds, and of litchi
nuts. But do you think he was interested? Not at all.
He would not even look at them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The wind is blowing hard. Would it amuse the
Little Old Ancestor to watch the kites fly?” asked old
Lord Mighty Swishing Dragon’s Tail.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Little Emperor didn’t know whether it would
or not. However, he couldn’t be more bored than he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>was already, so he climbed down from his throne and
went out into the windy autumn garden.</p>

<p class='c012'>First marched the musicians, beating on drums to
let every one know that the Emperor was coming.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came the Court Ladies tottering along on their
“golden lilies,” which is what they call their tiny feet
that have been bound up tightly to keep them small
ever since the ladies were babies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then the Mandarins with their long pigtails and
their padded silk coats whose big sleeves held fans
and tobacco and bags of betel nuts and sheets of pale
green and vermilion writing paper.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then Princess Autumn Cloud in a jade green gown
embroidered with a hundred lilac butterflies, a lilac
jacket, and pale rose-colored trousers tied with lilac
ribbons. In her ears, around her arms, and on her
fingers were jade and pearls, and her rose-colored
shoes were trimmed with tassels of pearls and were so
tiny that she could hardly hobble. In her shiny black
hair she wore on one side a big peony, the petals made
of mother-of-pearl and the leaves of jade. Each
petal and leaf was on a fine wire so that when she
moved her head they trembled as real flowers do when
the wind blows over them. On the other side were
two jade butterflies that trembled too. In front of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>her, walking backward, went her Lady-In-Waiting
holding the golden tear bowl, in case the Princess
should suddenly begin to cry.</p>

<p class='c012'>And last of all, surrounded by his Gentlemen-In-Waiting,
came the Little Emperor, dressed from head
to foot in yellow, the Imperial color, so that he looked
like a yellow baby duckling. And as he came every
one in the Palace and in the Garden had to stop whatever
they were doing—gossiping, teasing the Royal
monkeys, chewing betel nuts, or sweeping up dead
leaves—and kneel down and knock their heads on the
ground until he had passed.</p>

<p class='c012'>How the wind was blowing! It sent the willow
branches streaming, it wrinkled the lake water and
turned the lotus leaves wrong side out, it scattered the
petals of the chrysanthemums. It tossed the kites high
in the air. How brightly their colors shone against
the gray sky! Some were made to look like pink
and yellow melons with trailing leaves, some were like
warriors in vermilion, some were golden fish, others
were black bats, and the biggest one of all was a
great blue-green dragon.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for the Little Emperor, he took one look at
them and then yawned so hard that they were afraid
he would dislocate his jaw.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>A little brown bird the color of a dead leaf had
been hopping about on the ground under the chrysanthemums
looking for something for its supper, and
now suddenly flew up into a willow tree and began
to sing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Little Emperor clapped his hands, and all his
servants dropped on their knees and began to kowtow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Catch me that little brown bird with the beautiful
song!” he said. He stopped yawning, and his eyes
grew bright with eagerness.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, Little Old Ancestor, that is such a plain little
bird,” said his aunt timidly. “Surely you would rather
have a cockatoo as pink as a cloud at dawn, or a pair
of lovebirds as green as leaves in spring——”</p>

<p class='c012'>The rude Little Emperor paid not the slightest attention
to her, but stamped his foot and shouted:</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Catch me that little brown bird!</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>So his servants chased the poor little fluttering bird
with butterfly nets. The wind whipped their bright
silk skirts, and their pigtails streamed out behind, and
they puffed and panted, for they were most of them
very fat.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
<img src='images/i_071.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>His servants chased the bird with butterfly nets.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>And at last the bird was caught, and put in a cage
trimmed with tassels of purple silk and pearls, with
drinking cup and seed cup made like the halves of
plums from purple amethysts on brown amber twigs
with green jade leaves.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a time the Little Emperor was delighted with
his new pet, and every day he carried it in its cage
when he went for a walk. But it never sang, only
beat against the bars of its cage, or huddled on its
perch, so presently he grew tired of it, and it was
hung up in its cage in a dark corner of one of the
Palace rooms, where he soon forgot all about it.</p>

<p class='c013'>How could the little bird sing? It was sick for
the wide blue roads of the air, for wet green rice fields
where the coolies stand with bare legs, sky-blue shirts,
and bamboo hats as big as umbrellas, for the yellow
rivers, and the mountains bright with red lilies. How
could it sing in a cage? But sometimes it tried to
cry to them: “Let me out! Please, <i>please</i> let me out!
I have never done anything to harm you! I am so
unhappy I think my heart is breaking! <i>Please</i> let me
go free!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a sweet song!” everybody would say. “Run
and tell the Little Emperor that his bird is singing
again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>After a while the little bird realized that they did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>not understand, and it tried no longer, but drooped,
dull-eyed and silent, in its cage.</p>

<p class='c013'>One night the Little Emperor had a dream. Perhaps
you won’t wonder when I tell you what he had
for supper.</p>

<p class='c012'>First he had tea in a bowl of jade as round and
white as the moon, heaped up with honeysuckle
flowers.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, in yellow lacquer boxes, sugared seeds, sunflower
and lotus flower and watermelon seeds, boiled
walnuts, and lotus buds.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then velvety golden peaches and purple plums with
a bloom of silver on them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pork cooked in eleven different ways: chopped, cold,
with red beans and with white beans, with bamboo
shoots, with onions, and with cherries, with eggs, with
mushrooms, with cabbage, and with turnips.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ducks and chickens stuffed with pine needles and
roasted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Smoked fish.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shrimps and crabs, fried together.</p>

<p class='c012'>Shark fins.</p>

<p class='c012'>Boiled birds’ nests.</p>

<p class='c012'>Porridge of tiny yellow seeds like bird seed.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Cakes in the shapes of seashells, fish, dragons, butterflies,
and flowers.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chrysanthemum soup, steaming in a yellow bowl
with a green dragon twisting around it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Not one other thing did that poor Little Emperor
have for his supper!</p>

<p class='c012'>When he was so full that he couldn’t hold anything
more, not even one sugared watermelon seed, they took
off his silk napkin embroidered with little brown
monkeys eating pink and orange persimmons. He was
so sleepy that he did not even stamp his feet when
they washed his face and hands. Then they took off
his red silk gown embroidered with gold dragons and
blue clouds and lined with soft gray fur, his yellow
silk shirt and his red satin shoes with their thick white
soles. But he went to bed in his pale yellow pantaloons,
tied around the ankles with rose-colored ribbons.</p>

<p class='c012'>I must tell you about his bed. It was made of brick,
and inside of it a small fire was built to keep the Little
Emperor warm. On top of this three yellow silk mattresses
were placed, then silk sheets, red, yellow, green,
blue, and violet, then a coverlet of yellow satin embroidered
with stars. Under his head were pillows
stuffed with tea leaves; and above him was a canopy of
yellow silk, embroidered with a great round moon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>whose golden rays streamed down the yellow silk curtains
drawn around him.</p>

<p class='c013'>He fell asleep, and this is what he dreamed.</p>

<p class='c012'>The long golden rays seemed to turn into the bars of
a cage. Yes, he was in a huge cage! He tried frantically
to get out! He beat against the bars! Then he
saw what looked like the roots of trees, and brown tree
trunks, a grove all around the cage. But the trees
moved and stepped about, and, looking up the trunks,
instead of leaves he saw feathers, and still farther,
sharp beaks, and then bright eyes looking at him.
They were birds!</p>

<p class='c012'>What he had thought were the roots of trees were
their claws, and the trunks of the trees were their legs.
But what enormous birds! They were as big as men,
while he was as small as a bird.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me out!” he shouted. “Don’t you know I am
the Emperor, and every one must obey me? Let me
out, I say!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, he is beginning to sing,” said one bird to
another.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not a very musical song. Too shrill by far! Take
my advice, wring his neck and roast him. He would
make a tender, juicy morsel for our supper.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
<img src='images/i_077.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>“Please, <i>please</i> let me out!”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Oh, let me out! Please, <i>please</i> let me out!” cried
the poor Little Emperor in terror.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is singing more sweetly now,” remarked one of
the birds.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Too loud! Quite ear-splitting!” said a lady bird,
fluffing out her breast feathers and lifting her wings
to show how sensitive she was.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If he were mine I should pluck him. His little yellow
silk trousers would line my nest so softly.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, please, <i>please</i> set me free!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Really, his song is growing quite charming! But
one can’t stand listening to it all day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And with a great whir and flap and rustle of wings
the birds flew away and left him in his cage, alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>He called for help and threw himself against the
bars until he was exhausted. Then bruised, panting,
his heart nearly breaking out of his body, he lay on the
floor of the cage. Finally, growing hungry and thirsty,
he looked in his seed and water cups, drank a little
lukewarm water, and ate a dry bread crumb. Now
and then birds came and looked at him. Some of them
tried to catch his pigtail with their beaks or claws.</p>

<p class='c013'>Next day the Little Emperor was thoughtful. Could
it be, he wondered, that a little bird’s nest was as dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to it as his own bed with its rainbow coverlets and its
moon and stars was to him? That a little bird liked
ripe berries and cold brook water as much as he liked
ripe peaches and tea with jasmine flowers? That a
little bird was as frightened when he tried to catch
its tail in his fingers as he was when the birds tried to
catch his pigtail?</p>

<p class='c012'>And then he thought of how he had felt when the
lady bird had wanted his pantaloons to line her nest,
and, hot with shame, he remembered his glistening
jewel-bright blue cloak made of thousands of kingfishers’
feathers. It had made him miserable to think
of their taking his clothes, but suppose his clothes grew
on him as their feathers did on them? How would he
have felt then, hearing the bird say: “<i>I</i> should pluck
him. His little silk trousers would line my nest so
softly”?</p>

<p class='c012'>He went to bed thinking about his little brown bird,
and before he shut his eyes he made up his mind to set
it free in the morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he fell asleep, and once again he dreamed
that he was in the golden cage.</p>

<p class='c012'>Whir-rr! One of the great birds flew down by
the cage door. With his claw he unfastened it—opened
it!</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Oh, how exciting! The Little Emperor tore out, so
afraid he would be stopped and put back in the cage!</p>

<p class='c012'>Oh, how he ran across the room and through the
open door! Free! He was free! Tears rushed to
his eyes, and his heart felt as if it would burst with
happiness.</p>

<p class='c012'>But it was winter. The garden was deep in snow
that was falling as if it would never stop. The peaches
and plums were gone, and the lotus pond was frozen
hard as stone.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_081.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Little Emperor had never been out in the snow
before except when he was dressed in his warm padded
clothes, with one Gentleman-In-Waiting carrying his
porcelain stove, and another bringing tea, and a third
with cakes in a box of yellow lacquer, and a fourth
holding between the snowflakes and the Imperial head
a great, moss-green umbrella. So small and helpless
in so big and cold a world, what could a little boy find
to eat or drink? Where could he warm himself? He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>ran frantically through the snow. The rose-colored
ribbons that tied his pantaloons came untied and trailed
behind him, and the cold snow went up his bare legs.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pausing to catch his sobbing breath, he looked up to
see the thick snow sliding from a pine tree branch, and
jumped aside just in time to keep from being buried
beneath it. Then on he plunged again, growing with
each step more weak and cold and hungry; stopping
now and then to call for help in a quavering voice that
grew feebler every time; blinking back the tears that
froze on his lashes as he tried to remember that emperors
must never cry; then struggling on through the
blinding snow, a little boy lost and alone.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, as it began to grow dark, he saw two great
lanterns shining through the snow, coming slowly
nearer. Perhaps his aunt and his Chief Gentleman-In-Waiting,
Lord Mighty Swishing Dragon’s Tail
(Lord Dragon Tail, for short) had missed him and had
come with lanterns to look for him! He tried to go
toward them, to call, but he was too exhausted to move
or make a sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then, imagine his terror when he realized that
the glowing green lights were not lanterns at all, but
the eyes of a great crouching animal—a cat!</p>

<p class='c012'>Gathering all his strength for one last desperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>effort, he tried to run. But with a leap the cat was after
him, and with a paw now rolled into a velvet ball, now
unsheathing sharp curved claws, tapped him first on
one side, then on the other, nearly let him go, caught
him again with one bound, and with a harder blow
sent him spinning into stars and darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some one was shaking him. Was it the cat? The
Little Emperor opened his eyes and saw the frightened
face of Princess Autumn Cloud bending over him,
as yellow as a lemon, for she had jumped up out of bed
when she heard him cry out in his sleep, and there
hadn’t been time to put on the honey and the powder,
to paint on the surprised black eyebrows or the round
red mouth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wake up, wake up, Little Old Ancestor!” she was
crying as she shook him. “You’re having a bad
dream!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aren’t you the cat?” asked the Little Emperor, who
wasn’t really awake yet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Certainly <i>not</i>, Little Old Ancestor!” replied his
aunt, rather offended.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Little Emperor climbed out of his bed. The
room was full of the still white light that comes from
snow, and looking out of the window he saw that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>plum trees and the cherry trees looked as if they had
blossomed in the night, the snow lay so white and light
on every twig. Softly the snow fell, deep, deep it lay,
and the people who passed by his windows went as
silently as though they were shod in white velvet.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Little Emperor thought of his dream, and decided
that his little bird might suffer and die if he let
it go free before winter was over. But he explained
to the bird, and tried to make it happier.</p>

<p class='c012'>“When summer comes, you shall fly away into the
sky,” he told it. He brought it fruit and green leaves
to peck at, talking to it gently. And the little bird
seemed to understand. The dull eyes grew brighter;
and though it never sang it sometimes chirped as if it
were trying to say: “Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On the first night of summer when the moon lay like
a great round pearl in the deep blue sea of the sky, the
Little Emperor slept, and dreamed again that the cage
door opened for him and let him go free. But oh, what
happiness now, happiness almost too great for a little
boy to bear.</p>

<p class='c012'>Peonies were in bloom, each petal like a big seashell,
and blue butterflies floated over them in the warm
sunshine. Half hidden in the grass the Little Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>found a great purple fruit—a mulberry. How good it
was!</p>

<p class='c012'>The dewy spider webs glistened like the great tinsel
Bridge to Heaven they built for him on every birthday.
How happy he was! How happy! Free and
safe! With the sun to warm him and the breeze to
cool him; with food tumbling down from Heaven or
the mulberry trees, he wasn’t sure which, with a crystal
clear dewdrop to drink on every blade of grass. How
happy he was!</p>

<p class='c012'>The lake was full of great rustling leaves and big
pink lotus flowers. Venturing out on one of the leaves,
he paddled his feet over its edge in the gently lapping
water. Then, climbing into one of the pink blossoms,
he lay, so happy, so happy, looking up at the blue-green
dragon flies darting overhead, and rocking gently in
his rosy boat.</p>

<p class='c012'>No, it was not the lotus flower that rocked him on
the water. It was Princess Autumn Cloud who was
gently shaking him, and saying: “Wake up, if you
please, dear Little Old Ancestor!” And hard as it is
to believe, she was really smiling. The Little Emperor
had been so good lately, and then it was such a beautiful
day!</p>

<p class='c012'>He could not wait until after breakfast to let his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>little brown bird go free. As soon as he was dressed
he ran as fast as he could to the room where the bird
cage hung. Pat-a-pat-pat went his little feet in their
blue satin shoes, and thud, thud! puff, puff! his fat old
Gentlemen-In-Waiting lumbered along behind him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve come to set you free!” he whispered, as he carried
the cage with its tassels of purple and pearls out
into the beautiful day. For one minute he wanted to
cry, for he had grown to love the little bird. But he
remembered again that emperors must not cry. He
opened the door of the cage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Little Old Ancestor’s bird has flown away!” cried
the Mandarins.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It has flown so high in the sky that we can hardly
see it,” the Court Ladies answered; and they all wished
that the Little Emperor would stop gazing up into the
sky at the little dark speck, so that they might go in
and have their breakfasts.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the Little Emperor, the empty bird cage in his
hand, still looked up. High, high in the sky! And
now, really, he could no longer see it. But a thread
of song dropped down to him, a silver thread of song,
a golden thread of love between the hearts of a little
bird and a little boy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thank you, oh, thank you, my Little Emperor!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>“King” Philippe’s Dream</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Up into the sky rose the hundred horses and their great Coach,
until the roof of the Little Emperor’s Palace with its bright
yellow tiles looked only as big as a yellow autumn leaf—as a jasmine
petal—as nothing at all! And along the Road of Stars they galloped,
while notes of music sprayed from the wheels of the Coach,
and, dropping to earth, gave the nightingales ideas for beautiful new
songs.</p>

<p class='c012'>On through the sky and above the earth until the night was over,
and at last, instead of a road, the hundred horses were galloping
along a river. All along the river bank tall poplars rustled and
whispered in the wind of the Coach’s passing, and little waves, stirred
up by the horses’ hoofs, slapped against the small houses that rose
from the water, small pink houses and blue houses and white red-roofed
houses, each with its rowboat tied to its steps. White swans
and green ducks rocked on the ripples, their feathers gilded by sunshine,
for it was bright day now, and the rain that had been pouring
down had stopped. It was bright day, and yet no one saw the Dream
Coach except a little French boy, whose eyes were falling shut in one
little pink cottage.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Philippe! Philippe!” the Driver called. “One last dream is left
for you!”</p>

<p class='c012'>What was Philippe’s dream?</p>

<p class='c012'>That you shall hear.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>
“Hold still then, my little monkey!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But mother,” wailed Philippe, “I have the
soap in my eye!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Soap is it, my angel?” asked his mother, lifting his
face in her two wet hands. “Oh, but there is really no
soap at all to speak about, just a bubble or two of suds.
<i>There!</i>” and with the corner of her apron she wiped
away the thick white lather around his eyelashes, so
that Philippe looked like a little boy made of snow,
except for his eyes which were large and brown and
filled with tears from the painful smarting. From
head to ankles he was covered with a froth of soapsuds,
and his feet had stirred the warm water in the bottom
of the wooden tub into rainbow-tinted mounds of
bubbles which grew and grew and cascaded over the
sides with a tiny fizzing sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are giving our young one a very thorough
tubbing,” remarked Philippe’s father. He was sitting
under the narrow window of their cottage, cutting the
yellow-white sprouts from a bag of potatoes which he
intended to plant in the dark of the next moon.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Indeed I am. I shall scrub and rub and polish until
he looks like a wax image, or as pink and shining as
the inside of the seashell his Uncle Pablôt sent him
from Paimpol.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe’s father held a large brown potato at arm’s
length, and, regarding it with his head cocked to one
side, said: “Very fine! Yes, very fine!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A good size,” agreed his wife, looking over her
shoulder, while she absently bored into the ear of her
long-suffering son with a bit of soapy rag.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—but I was thinking rather of Philippe’s Uncle
Pablôt. It is he who is very fine, a grand gentleman
who carries a gold-headed cane and has traveled far—to
the very borders of our beloved France, and even
beyond, so I hear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, very much beyond! He has been in every
country in the world, according to the wonderful stories
he tells, and the world, Pierre, I understand to be
of a tremendous bigness; indeed, if what I am told
is the truth, it must be three or four times as big as our
own country!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is that so?” replied Pierre doubtfully, starting to
cut the pallid sprouts again with quick motions of his
work-hardened hands. “It may all be the truth, my
good wife, but I have always taken the words of Pablôt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>with a grain of salt; I think, for that matter, that he is
a little inclined to blow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Blow’?” asked Philippe from his tub. “I thought
it was only the wind that could blow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But of course no one answered him, for he was only
a little boy, and not expected to understand; instead,
his father bent over his bag of potatoes to hide his smile,
and his mother remembered that the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pot-au-feu</span></i> (which
is a thick soup made of odds and ends and bits and
scraps and almost everything you can think of mixed
with water in a large pot and left on the fire to bubble
sluggishly for many hours) needed stirring right away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Take care,” warned her husband, “that you do
not drop soap into the soup from your wet hands,
for I know of nothing that gives it a more curious
flavor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just the same,” said Philippe’s mother, turning
from the hearth, her cheeks flushed rosy red by the
bright, hot embers, “just the same, it is a good thing
that our little one should be invited to meet such a fine
gentleman. It will teach him how to say the most
ordinary thing elegantly, and how to carry his head
high as if he were a born dandy. Philippe, repeat to
your father the little speech you are to say when you
meet your uncle.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Good health to you, my dear and illustrated uncle!
It gives——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no, my pet, ‘my dear and <i>illustrious</i> uncle,’
and was there not something that you forgot?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Mother. I forgot to make my bow. Shall I
make a new beginning?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do so.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Whereupon Philippe bent nearly double over the
edge of the tub, scattering drops of water upon the
floor.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good health to you, my dear and illustrious uncle.
It gives me the most great pleasure to have—<i>eugh!</i>
soap in my mouth.... <i>Ptu!</i>——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait, then, until you are dressed in the new suit
I have sewn for you,” and his mother, taking an earthen
jar of water from the side of the fire where it had been
put to warm, poured it over his head, leaving him no
longer a snow boy, but a boy made of the shiniest china
you can imagine. “Is that pleasant, my brave one?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is warm, like rain,” said Philippe, lifting his
arms above his head. “I will not need another washing
for a long, long time, will I, Mother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Philippe’s grandparents lived the distance of twelve
fields, a small woods, three stiles, and the width of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>brook from his own home. Just how far that is, is
hard to say. You see it makes such a difference whom
you ask. Ask the swallows and they will tell you airily
that it is no distance at all, just a flick of the wing, and
you are there. But ask the snails who live under the
broad leaves of the flowering mulleins, and after pondering
a long time, they will tell you that it gives them
a headache to think of such a tremendous distance, that
it would surely take several lifetimes to travel so far,
and as for themselves, they would consider it very
foolish to start out on such a dangerous adventure when
there were plenty of young lettuces so close at hand!
To a small boy of eight, it was quite a long journey,
taken alone, particularly when he could not take the
short cut by wriggling through the tangled copse for
fear of tearing his new suit, or being covered with
last year’s burrs and barbed seeds of the undergrowth.
But he reached his Grandparents’ house at last.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a little house built by the side of a river,
actually touching the water on one side, so that you
could step out of a door, down a step, and into a rowboat.
And there were white swans and yellow-breasted
ducks with bronze-green backs swimming in the reflection
of the pink walls. On the land side was a poplar
tree, very tall and dressed in silvery blue leaves, standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>erect like a giant soldier on guard before a toy
house. Once Philippe’s Grandfather had explained to
him how he could tell the time of day by the shadow
this tree cast: when it struck across the chimney at the
corner of the house, it was time to go into the fields;
when it crossed the front door, it was time to enter
therein for the midday meal, and when it pointed
out toward the fields, that was a signal for Grandmother
to ring the great bell that would call the
workers home.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what,” Philippe had asked, “do you do,
Grandfather, when the sun is under the clouds, and
there is no shadow to tell the time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then we must needs look at the clock which
ticks on the mantelshelf over the fire,” Grandfather
said with a twinkle of his old, blue eyes, eyes half
hidden by the tufts of white eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c012'>Although the day had commenced unusually fine,
and the calm, blue sea of sky had been without an island
reef or bar of cloud to wreck the golden galleon of
the sun, by the time Philippe had been tubbed,
scrubbed, dressed in his best, had been rehearsed in his
address to his uncle, kissed good-by, and given a little
nosegay of pansies and lilies of the valley in a paper
twist for his Grandmother, and had crossed the twelve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>fields and picked his way carefully through the woods
to avoid the sharp brambles that reached out after him
with long and sinuous arms—by the time all this had
come to pass, and Philippe was actually in sight of his
grandparents’ cottage, it began to rain from a sky as
heavily gray as it had been brightly blue before. It
started so suddenly that Philippe had to run across the
last field to keep the big drops from ruining his new
black velvet cap.</p>

<p class='c012'>The inside of the house was very dark, with only
two windows, like half-closed eyes, looking out on the
world. Through these windows entered shafts of pale,
watery light that cut blue paths in the wreaths of wood
smoke creeping around the rafters. Pots, pans, and
kettles of burnished copper hung from hooks in the
ceiling, and mirrored in tiny points the flames leaping
on the hearth. It was like another world, small but
complete, inside Grandmother’s and Grandfather’s
house: the floor was the earth itself, trampled until it
was as hard as brick, the wreaths of smoke were
thin clouds flung across a dark sky where yellow and
red stars winked and twinkled. At one end of the
room, where Grandmother and Anjou, the cat, were
busy preparing dinner over the bright fire, it was gay
and warm: <i>Day</i>; but at the farther end, where Grandfather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>sat stroking his long white beard, it was dark
and chilly: <i>Night</i>.</p>

<p class='c012'>When Philippe entered, he had to blink his eyes
for some time before he could adjust himself to the
darkness. Then he handed his Grandmother the bouquet
he had carried so carefully, politely wishing her
health and happiness.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were tears in Grandmother’s eyes as she bent
over and kissed her Grandson’s pink and shining cheek,
but then there were always tears in Grandmother’s
eyes—why, Philippe never could understand. Did
she weep because of the stinging smoke that the chimney
seemed too small to carry off? Or because she was
sad? Not sad, thought Philippe, or Grandmother
would not be all the time smiling.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hey-O!” sang Grandmother in her high little voice,
dropping a tear in the yellow heart of a purple pansy.
“What pretty flowers you have brought me, my Philippe,
and see, here is a raindrop in one of them
shining as prettily as a glass bead!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe did not like to tell her that it was her own
tear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then it is raining out?” she asked. “It will make
a wet home-coming for your uncle, but it is lovely,
nevertheless, and if it comes down hard enough, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>will make the river flow along more happily than it
has for a long day. Won’t that be beautiful, Philippe?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Grandmother Marianne,” Philippe agreed
politely, and then asked: “When will my Uncle Pablôt
be here? Mother has taught me what to say when I
make my bow to him, and if he is too long in coming,
I am afraid that I may forget it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He will come,” said Grandmother, “when he has
a mind to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And is he coming from a great distance, maybe all
the way from Paris?” (Philippe thought that Paris
was the only city in the world, built on the world’s very
edge.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“Maybe, and then maybe not,” Grandmother told
him. “There is no telling where your uncle will come
from; he is apt to blow in from any quarter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, then that explains it!” remarked Philippe innocently.
“Father said he always thought Uncle
Pablôt was a little inclined to blow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now did he!” Grandmother was frowning and
smiling at one and the same time. “Have you spoken
to your Grandfather yet?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I did not know that Grandfather Joseph was home;
I did not see him,” said Philippe truthfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Use your young eyes sharply and look into every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>corner,” advised Grandmother. “Anjou!” she cried
warningly, “you will burn your nose if you get too
close to that roasting duck.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe gazed into the farthest corner of the room
where he saw two dim spots of white glowing like snow
in the night; he had to advance quite near before he
could be sure that what he saw was the long white
hair and the long white beard of Grandfather.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good day, Grandfather Joseph,” said Philippe,
bowing low before the old man who sat huddled in a
chair, the arms of which were worn shiny by the grip
of thin fingers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Good day’? A very <i>bad</i> day, Grandson. Though
I no longer hear nor see as I used to, I can feel that it
is raining. Tell me, is it raining?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Grandfather,” replied Philippe from the top
of a churn where he had climbed to look out of the
small window at the river. “It is falling so hard that
the raindrops are bouncing from the surface of the
water.” Remembering what his Grandmother had told
him, he added, “It will make the river flow along more
happily than it has for a long time, and that will be
very beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Horrible!</i>” said Grandfather with a sigh that was
almost too soft to be heard. “It makes me feel weak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>clear through,” he continued. “Give me the sharp cold
and the sparkling frost when the river freezes so hard
that it cracks and roars like a cannon. When I was a
boy, I used to spread my cape and let the wind push me
across the slippery ice—— This soft weather will be
the end of me!”</p>

<p class='c012'>There were three people living in the house that
Philippe visited; besides Grandmother and Grandfather,
there was little Avril, their grandniece, and
therefore Philippe’s cousin. Avril was a child of
tender beauty, younger than Philippe, quite a baby in
the sight of eyes that were eight long years old. Avril
was very shy, so shy that she had hidden under the table
when Philippe had entered the door, and it was not
until he had paid his respects to Grandmother and
Grandfather that he saw her there, peeking out at him
like a flower from the dark shadow of a garden wall.
“Hello, my little cousin,” said Philippe with a grand
and grown-up air. “Would you like to play a very
important game with me that I have just thought of?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Avril laughed her pleasure.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was a most excellent game, so Philippe thought.
He was King, enthroned on the churn, and Avril was
his slave, and had to bring him anything he might
request, with the penalty of having her head chopped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>off if she failed. King Philippe had just commanded
the brightest star in the heavens to be brought him,
when there was all at once a loud rapping and rattling
of the wooden latch. The door flew open before anyone
had time to answer, and a gust of chilly wind
swept through the room, breaking the weaving rings
of smoke, making the fire leap up the chimney, causing
Grandmother in her excitement to drop the wooden
spoon into the pudding, and even waving Grandfather’s
beard like a white flag.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Behold!</i> I am here!” cried Uncle Pablôt from the
threshold, withdrawing his right arm from the voluminous
folds of his cape and making a magnificent
sweeping gesture ending with his fingertips being
pressed lightly against his expanded chest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So I see,” said Grandfather in a thin, complaining
voice from his dark corner. “Close the door,” he
pleaded, tucking the end of his waving beard into his
blue smock. “Close the door—the rain makes me feel
very weak——”</p>

<p class='c012'>But no one paid the least bit of attention to him.
Grandmother ran forward with squeaking noises of
delight, throwing her arms around the newcomer,
draping him with a link of sausage, which she had forgotten
to put down in her hurry, in the manner of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>necklace. Avril shyly retreated beneath the table
again, and Philippe tried desperately to remember the
pretty sentences with which he was to address the great
man. He was in the very middle of trying to remember
when his Grandmother took him by the hand.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And here is your little nephew,” said Grandmother,
“who has come all by himself a great distance to welcome
you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe stared dumbly, wishing that he had had
the presence of mind to slip under the table with Avril.</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Come!</i> What do you say to your uncle, Philippe?”
asked Grandmother.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I forget what I say,” answered Philippe miserably,
“but I am very glad to see you, my—my——Ah!
Now it comes to me!” And he started again: “Good
health to you, my dear and illustrious uncle. It gives
me the most——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fiddlesticks!” interposed Uncle Pablôt, laughing.</p>

<p class='c012'>“—the most great pleasure to welcome you,
and——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes—” said Uncle Pablôt, cutting him short
again. “But what do you say to this?” and he reached
into the folds of his cape and handed Philippe something
small and shining.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it?” asked Philippe.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Ho! That is better. At least you did not learn
that by heart, did you, my boy? Here, I will show
you.” Whereupon he put the bright present to his
lips and blew a shrill blast that rattled the pots and
made Grandmother drop her sausages in alarm. (She
dusted them very carefully before putting them in the
hot pan that was waiting to cook them.)</p>

<p class='c012'>“A <i>whistle</i>!” shouted Philippe, dancing with joy.
Then he ducked under the table to show his beautiful
new present to Avril.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And here is a present for the other little one,” said
Uncle Pablôt, handing the shyly smiling girl a toy
spade with a bright green handle and a wreath of early
spring flowers painted on the tiny blade.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_102.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>What a feast they had in honor of their distinguished
guest!</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose,” said Grandmother to Uncle Pablôt,
“that you have traveled a great distance since last you
visited us?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Yes, yes,” said Uncle Pablôt, flourishing the wing
of a duck. “I have breezed about a bit, here, there,
and everywhere. Would you like to hear a little about
my travels?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, <i>please</i>!” begged Philippe, although the question
had not been addressed to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now there is India,” commenced Uncle Pablôt, “a
very hot country, but as gay as a circus——” And
over the roast duck he told them many things in his
soft and flowing voice, of elephants, their enormous
bodies painted brilliantly in curlicues, circles, and zigzags,
swaying through narrow streets like clumsy ships
of the land, ridden by dark-skinned potentates robed
in ivory satin and scarlet brocades, wearing precious
jewels more sparkling than broken bits of colored glass&nbsp;... of
softly stepping and treacherous tigers prowling
in deep jungles, of lions and leopards, crouching
panthers and laughing hyenas and all manner of beasts&nbsp;... of
birds with emerald crests, sapphire wings,
breasts of flaming orange, long, sweeping tails and
screaming falsetto voices that seemed to shatter the air
into sharp and hurtling splinters&nbsp;... of gorilla
fathers with so terrible a power in their long arms that
they could uproot a tree as easily as one would pick a
dandelion, and gorilla mothers holding babies to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>breasts as gently and lovingly as any human mothers&nbsp;... of
chattering pink monkeys shouting in derisive
laughter from their hiding places in the tree tops at
passers-by. Leaving the wildness of the tropic forests,
he told them of queer-shaped temples and pagodas,
lifting to the blue of the sky, made of stone carved as
beautifully as lace, where lived the leering and laughing
gods of the heathen.</p>

<p class='c012'>By the time Grandmother had put the crisp green
lettuces on the table, Uncle Pablôt had carried his little
audience to far-away China and, without so much as
a “by your leave,” into the gardens of mandarins and
emperors where jasmine filled the air with sweetness,
and rose and white peonies bowed their heavy heads
around the lily ponds. Far away and far away they
flew on Uncle Pablôt’s winged words: over snowy
mountains tinted with the pink and lavender radiance
of the dawn, through the fiery furnace of desert sands
where haughty camels plodded their weary course to
the beat of Arab drum and the mystical rhythm of
Arab song, up broad rivers where crocodiles basked in
the sun&nbsp;... past cities with towers and turrets,
through the courtyards of palace and castle, into the
riot of crowded markets with their laughter and shouting,
buying and selling, into a land where the streets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>were water, where the buildings had wings that turned
and turned, where the men and boys wore tight little
jackets of velvet fastened with brass buttons, and
trousers as big as two sacks sewn together. “Oh, yes,”
said Uncle Pablôt, “and they all wear wooden shoes so
that they can walk safely across the streets of water
without sinking.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Remarkable!” said Grandmother.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If true,” said Grandfather, but he spoke so low
that every one thought that he was merely choking, and
paid no attention to him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“More!” pleaded Philippe.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>“And I was in England the other day,” continued
Uncle Pablôt, who needed little urging, “where I
visited the Royal Family. That is nothing,” he said,
in answer to a look of proud astonishment from Grandmother.
“I have a great many acquaintances in all
walks of life. Once I mussed up the hair of a prince
and ran off with the parasol of a duchess, just by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>way of a little joke, you know. Did I ever tell
you——”</p>

<p class='c012'>But if he ever had, he told them again, and at such
length that, though the dinner had come to an end, and
Grandmother had cleared away the dishes and given
Anjou a saucer of milk and a bone, he was still telling
them this and other monstrous adventures in his quick,
easy voice. How thrilling it all was to Philippe. It
seemed to him that the gay words flew from his uncle’s
mouth and over his head like flocks of wild birds.
Some of them were quite ordinary little words, as sparrows
are ordinary little birds, but others were long
and strange like the queer birds his uncle had told him
about. Or again—this tale of other lands and peoples
was like music to which the crackling of the fire and
the drip, drip of the rain outside made a soothing accompaniment.
He tried hard to keep his eyes and ears
wide open, but, to tell the truth, he had eaten very
heartily of Grandmother’s delicious dinner, and that,
with the darkness of the room, the lullaby singsong of
his uncle’s voice, and the soft purring of Anjou, made
him heavy-headed and in danger of falling into sleep
at any moment. Voices came to him through the fog
of smoke, sounding far, far away. He heard his uncle
say, “But you, Grandfather Joseph, you should go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>about the world a bit and see for yourself these wonderful
things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am content,” replied a soft, old voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, you are content to stay where you are put, or
at best to drift around a bit, eh?”</p>

<p class='c012'>And then the old man saying, “I drift—I drift—I
drift——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Maybe it was then that Philippe went to sleep, or,
on the other hand, maybe it was then that Philippe
overcame his drowsiness and woke up to a new interest
in things. Certainly, strange and exciting happenings
took place in rapid succession.</p>

<p class='c012'>It started with Grandmother going to the window
where she stood on tiptoe and looked out at the river.
“Oh,” she cried, and her voice was younger and happier
than Philippe had ever heard it before. “Oh! The
river has grown up; never before have I seen my darling
child so strong and beautiful. And how he runs
and laughs! In another minute he will be at the sill
of the window. I will open the door and invite him
in.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no!” cried Grandfather weakly, jumping up
from the chair and staring wildly about the room. “It
will be the end of me.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“But think, Joseph, how my child will love it! He
will splash and laugh—why, even now I can see him
creeping under the door in his eagerness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Without a word, gathering the baby Avril into his
arms, Grandfather dashed out of the other door; and
they watched him running across the fields and
meadows, his white hair and beard flying back over
his shoulders in the mad speed of his flight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now there is a strange man,” Grandmother said to
Uncle Pablôt.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pablôt only whistled softly and looked wise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“One would think,” continued Grandmother, “that
he would be grateful for a nice trip on the back of my
child. He will come to my way of thinking all in good
time.” She looked around her critically. “The fire!”
she said. “How fiercely the fire is burning! It quite
makes me boil with anger; I won’t have it, I hate it!”
and she ran upon it, scattering the embers with a great
hissing sound. “There now!” turning again to Pablôt.
“Do you think that the room is in readiness for my
son? Shall I open the floodgates and let him in?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How about Anjou?” asked Uncle Pablôt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Anjou can ride in his basket.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And Philippe?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The little cradle by the bed that Avril sleeps in—an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>excellent boat! Jump in, Philippe, run and jump
in, for we are going to make a voyage. I—let me see—this
tub will suit me nicely; I have a fondness for tubs;
and you, Pablôt, can run along the bank. Into your
basket, Anjou, <i>quick</i>! You look strangely unhappy,
my pet. Are we all ready? <i>Enter, my son!</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>Grandmother unlatched the door facing on the
river; it flew back against the wall with a crash. What
happened next was very confused in the mind of the
startled Philippe. There was a great, swishing roar
as the water of the river, swollen to unheard-of heights
by the hard rain, leaped and tumbled into the room in
masses and billows of silver foam. Tightly he clutched
the rail of the crib as his strange boat tossed and
turned and ducked and pitched and bobbed and spun
around and around in the currents and cross currents
and boiling waves. At last, when the water in the room
had reached the level of the water outside, and therefore
had suddenly quieted, he dared to look about him.
Uncle Pablôt had disappeared; Grandmother was
calmly sitting in her tub with a rapturous smile on her
old face. “So impulsive!” she remarked conversationally
to Philippe. “My son, the River,” she explained.
“He is so very glad to see me. Did you notice how he
jumped and romped when I let him in? It made me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>very proud! But we must not waste our time floating
idly here; there is to be a very important reunion of
my whole family.” And with that they were caught
in an eddying current and swept out of the door:
Anjou, with tail as erect as a mast; Philippe, wide-eyed
and silent in his cradle boat; and Grandmother
in her wooden tub, pleased and proud, the happy tears
streaming down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once you get over being frightened, it is really great
good fun, so Philippe found, to go racing along a swift-flowing
river in a little boat that nods to each passing
wave. They passed tall reeds and rushes that waved
gracefully to them from the shore, weeping willow
trees, their wands gray-green and crystal with rain,
gently caressing the surface of the water, emerald fields
patterned with yellow flowers shining wet, mallows by
the River’s edge, white with glowing hearts of deep
pink, deep pink with hearts of white.</p>

<p class='c012'>Sometimes swiftly, sometimes slowly, but always and
ever onward, “Grandmother’s Son” carried them on
his strong back; now through lowlands, and now between
high banks of dark chocolaty mud, where, from
the black portals of burrows and tunnels, the bright
eyes of water animals gazed at them in astonishment.
Yes, it was thoroughly delightful, but it was puzzling
to Philippe; there were many things that he did not
understand. He decided that he would ask Grandmother,
who was floating close to him in her wooden
tub.</p>

<p>Grandmother in her wooden tub.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Grandmother Marianne,” he called to her, “why
do you call the river your son?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Look at me, Philippe. Have I not changed?”
asked Grandmother. “I am no longer Grandmother
Marianne,” she said, “I am Grandmother Rain!... Without me there would be no puddles, no
pools, no lakes, no ponds, no rills and runs and rivulets,
no brooks and streams, no waterfalls, no rivers—their
lovely and happy voices would die from the land.
They are all my children. And if it were not for my
children, there would be no ocean.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is the ocean?” asked Philippe, who had never
been to the seashore.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That, my Philippe,” said Grandmother Rain, “is
where I was born, and where all my children return.
It is a beautiful place! And how your uncle loves
to play there—a decidedly worthy man, your uncle,
though at times a trifle flighty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>They passed a grove of trees, their bright branches
reaching out over the water.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How fresh and strong they look,” cried Grandmother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Rain. “They are always glad to see me, I can
assure you. Oh, I have strange adventures, Philippe.
Sometimes I am buried in the soft, brown earth, and
you would think that would be the end of me, now
wouldn’t you? But no!  I creep back into the air
through trunks of trees, through blades of grass and
stalks of flowers, and through the shoots of young corn.
I trickle through an endless maze of underground
passages into deep wells, or until I find a place where
I can come bubbling up to the surface. Every living
thing needs me and every living thing loves me, except
sometimes little boys kept in from play—eh?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe felt guilty, and was about to apologize
when Grandmother Rain put him at rest. “That is
not quite true. There are others,” she said, “who do a
good deal of complaining about me; they say that I am
an old spoil-sport just because I try to make myself
pleasant at their parties and picnics. But if I were to
leave them forever——” she made an odd little gesture
of despair. “Would you like me to sing you a song?”
she asked unexpectedly. “It might serve to pass the
time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please,” said Philippe, who was getting a bit tired
of floating aimlessly and never arriving anywhere.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well.” And this is what she sang:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah! <i>There</i> he comes!” cried Grandmother Rain
excitedly, forgetting to finish her song.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who?” asked Philippe, curious, like most boys.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who indeed?” replied Grandmother. “Look up
the shore. Now we will have some sport!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe did as he was told, and saw a small figure
hurrying toward them at a great pace. As the figure
drew nearer, he saw that it was Uncle Pablôt, running
along the edge of the water and stirring it to frenzy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hold tight!” warned Grandmother from her tub.</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe needed no warning, for as Uncle Pablôt
drew opposite to them, waves broke the smooth surface
of the river and tossed his little crib about like a
cockle shell. He could see, as he was twisted about,
that the rising waves were creeping over the edge of
Grandmother Rain’s tub and swamping it—it was sinking
lower and lower. “Be careful, Grandmother!” he
cried frantically.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is what I call delightful!” replied that remarkable
woman, tipping her tub until the water ran in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>and filled it with a deep gurgle. As she sank into the
river she clapped her hands, whereupon there was a
blinding flash and a peal of sharp thunder. A bigger
wave than the rest washed Philippe, cradle and all,
upon the shore. He was too dazed to understand for
some moments just what had happened, but at length
he spied Grandmother, already at some distance,
riding the waves and swimming strongly with the
current.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now I shall be in high time for the reunion!” she
called back to him, the growing space between them
making her voice very faint.</p>

<p class='c012'>Poor, dear Grandmother! Whatever would become
of her? She would drown most surely. But perhaps
Uncle Pablôt, who had raced on down the bank, could
save her——But no! He was strolling back; he had
given up. Philippe ran to meet his uncle with tears
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hello! So there you are, safe and sound and high
and dry, eh? You see, I veered about; I thought we
might take a little stroll together,” explained Uncle
Pablôt airily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Save her!” pleaded Philippe tearfully.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Who? Grandmother Rain? Be calm, my boy, she
is quite in her element.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“But unless we do something, the river will carry her
far away!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Which is exactly what she wishes. She will be back
again, never worry. She makes these little trips to the
ocean quite frequently. Look, Philippe, the sun is
coming out! The sun and Grandmother Rain do not
get along well together; he always hides as soon as she
has made her appearance, and when she has gone, he
goes about mopping up the whole countryside.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Uncle Pablôt’s calmness gave Philippe some comfort.
He was grown up, and therefore wise; perhaps
he knew the meaning of these strange things. “Do they
always disagree, Grandmother and the sun?” asked
Philippe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not always. Sometimes, though rarely, you may
see them together, and then they hang a rainbow flag
across the sky as a sign of their truce. But come! We
have much land to cover, we must hurry a little more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where are we going, Uncle Pablôt?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a silly question! How am I to know? I go
wherever it pleases me at the moment, sometimes for
days in one direction, and at other times this way and
that quicker than you can think. And please do not
call me Uncle Pablôt; I am your Uncle Wind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe felt rebuked; he trotted silently beside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>tall, lean fellow, thinking him a not very pleasant companion.
He would gladly have walked home alone,
but he had no idea where he was, and he was afraid
to be left alone. At length his Uncle Wind spoke to
him:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do not think unkindly of me, little Philippe. If I
was cross to you, it is because I am given to complaining
at times, but I am a good fellow at heart. With
Grandmother Rain’s help, I keep the world a nice clean
place to live in. And do you know, Philippe, the best
part of it is that I am such a humorous fellow; I am all
the time playing the most amusing jokes! Why—once
I mussed up the hair of a prince and ran off with the
parasol of a duchess.... There now! I think I told
you that once before, didn’t I? But where and when
it is quite past my ability to remember. Well, that
gives you the idea. Hats? There is nothing quite so
much fun as hats! Snatch a hat and run, drop it until
its owner is just about to pick it up, and then snatch
and run again. There’s nothing that draws such a large
and appreciative audience as the hat trick. Though,
of course, umbrellas are great sport—but I need Grandmother
Rain to help me with that trick. Maybe you
think I am only a practical joker? Not at all! Do you
remember that day you were sick, and your head felt as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>if it were on fire? Do you remember how I came and
cooled it for you, and played with the tassels of the
curtains until sundown to keep you amused? If I get
a bit angry and rough at times, I am gentleness itself
at others, and particularly am I loved in places that are
hot and stuffy and saddened by ill health. I am one of
the housekeepers of the earth, and I must be everlastingly
at it to make things comfortable and shipshape.
Oh! The dirt and the dust, the smoke and the foul
smells people throw into my face in the cities, little
dreaming that if it were not for me the earth would be
unfit to live on. But I am strong without end and do
my best. Yes, Philippe, I may bluster and blow and
play tricks, but for all that I am a very excellent
fellow. And I am a traveler and adventurer over land
and sea, such as one has never read of in the most thrilling
books! No one has seen more of the world than
I. I have seen strange parts of the world, looked behind
walls of ice, where no living thing has ever been.
Only the other day——”</p>

<p class='c012'>On and on talked Uncle Wind, and on and on traveled
the two together. Over more meadows they went
than Philippe thought could possibly be crowded into
the world, and past innumerable herds of cows and
flocks of sheep. It had grown warm with the coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of the sun, and often would workers in the fields spread
wide their arms and speak words of welcome as they
passed. The grass and the yellow wheat bowed as they
stepped lightly over them and even the trees nodded
in friendly recognition. Birds, stretching their wings,
took rides on Uncle Wind’s shoulders. At times Uncle
Wind would go quite fast, so that Philippe had to run,
and again, so slowly that they were scarcely creeping,
until, after a long time, they stopped quite still on the
top of a high hill.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I often lie down and rest at sunset,” explained
Uncle Wind in a voice that was scarcely above a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c012'>Far, far away, Philippe saw, through a twilight haze
of gold, what he had never seen before: the deep ocean
where Grandmother Rain was holding her family reunion.
The crimson sun was rolling over the blue edge
of the world into its sparkling heart. He sat down in
the crevice of a rock and thought long and wonderingly
of the things that had come to pass that day, and he
tried to see, in the land that was spread like a map
before his eyes, the red roof and clump of trees that
would be his own home. He did so long to be with
his darling mother again! And very soon it would be
dark.... Silver stars began to shine in a pale green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>sky.... Golden stars were lit in a sky of deepening
purple.... More and more stars in a sky dark blue.
Night had suddenly closed in around him, and he was
frightened and started to cry.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_122.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Uncle Pablôt—I mean, Uncle Wind—I want to
go home!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But where was Uncle Wind? There was no answer,
no sound, and search as carefully as he would, Philippe
could find no trace of him. It was as if he had utterly
vanished, which, indeed, he had, for the time being.</p>

<p class='c012'>What was poor Philippe to do? The hilltop stones
that surrounded him took menacing forms; he was sure
that he saw the shining eyes, green and glowing, of
prowling beasts. He summoned all his courage and
bravely started to walk—where? Downhill, for he
remembered that Grandmother Rain had told him,
as they floated along the river, that that was the only
way any sensible person would ever care to travel. Besides,
when you were on the top of a hill, unless you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>stayed there, there was no other choice. Where else he
was bound for he had no idea, but anything would be
better than the unbroken stillness of the haunted rocks.
How far he walked, at times ran, through the dark
night, falling over roots and tearing his way through
scratching brambles, pursued by unseen terrors of
darkness, before he came to the old man, he had no
idea.</p>

<p class='c012'>At first he was timid of approaching the bent figure
sitting huddled on a stump, so dim under the starlight.
But loneliness and the longing for companionship
overcame his fear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please, sir,” he said, drawing slowly closer, “please,
sir, could you tell me—— <i>Grandfather Joseph!
Grandfather Joseph!</i>”—and he flung his arms around
Grandfather’s neck, the hot tears streaming down his
cheeks. But how cold Grandfather was! The touch
of Grandfather’s face against Philippe’s burned like
ice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Watch out!” said Grandfather sharply, “You are so
insufferably warm you will melt me, if I do not succeed
in freezing you first. And, young Philippe, be
careful the names you call people. Look carefully at
me again; do you not know me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe was doubtful. Surely it was Grandfather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Joseph, and yet—Grandfather had never been so
cold, nor so strange in his behavior. Did he know
him?</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes—no,” answered Philippe, not being able
to decide.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, <i>Snow</i>, that is right! I am Grandfather
Snow.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s very upsetting!” remarked the puzzled boy.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it?” replied Grandfather Snow coldly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I may stay here with you, Grandfather? I was
so frightened alone in the black night. I was out walking
with Uncle Wind, and—and he seemed to disappear,
and then I lost my way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You may stay if you do not come too close. So
Uncle Wind vanished, did he? Your Uncle Wind is
a fickle, changeable, unreliable fellow, but he has a
will of his own and will turn up in time. I am very
dependent on Uncle Wind; I can do nothing but lie
around, without him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is very nice, isn’t he, Grandfather?” ventured
Philippe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye, sometimes,” replied the old man. “He was
all gentleness this afternoon, but wait until you see him
to-night! If I’m not mistaken in the signs, he will be
in a fury. Then watch out for yourself, Young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Impudence! When Uncle Wind is in a fury, he is a
hard master and drives every one before him with a
stinging lash. You’ll see!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Since Grandfather was in such a chilling mood,
Philippe did not bother to talk with him, but sat at
a little distance, thankful for companionship, and
watched the winking of the stars, which, even as he
watched them, sparkled and went out like sparks in the
soot of a chimney, or as if a black curtain were being
drawn across the black sky. After a long while, after
the last star had vanished and the noiseless quiet of the
night hemmed them in like an invisible wall, Grandfather
Snow sprang to his feet and stood tensely listening
with his hand to his ear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is it, Grandfather?” Philippe asked, alarmed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hush!... Hush!... Ah—now I hear
it plainly!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe put his hand to his ear as he had seen
Grandfather do, and listened intently, holding his
breath that he should not miss the tiniest sound. Nothing.
Yes—a far away and tiny sound. It sounded to
Philippe like the little gasping noises he had made
when he was learning to whistle, before ever he had
been able to attempt a tune, the noise of air breathed
in and out through rounded lips.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“<i>He is coming!</i>” Grandfather told him in a voice
trembling with excitement. “And he is perfectly
furious; seldom have I heard him whistle more beautifully.
<i>Listen!</i>”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe no longer had to strain to hear the far-away
whistling; it was growing nearer every second, and as
it approached it became high and shrill. “Is that my
Uncle Wind making all that noise, Grandfather?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye!” said Grandfather shortly, crouching close to
the ground in the position of a runner about to start
a race.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I shall run and meet him,” cried Philippe, delighted
at the idea of seeing his old friend again, who
was now evidently very close. He had not run twelve
steps when something spinning through the dark
ran squarely into him, bowled him off his feet and
rolled him along the ground as easily as if he had been
made of thistledown. It was a terrific struggle he had
to gain his feet again, and even when he had, and
would have liked to stop to catch his breath and dust
off the new suit his mother had made for him, he found
himself being shoved roughly from behind.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Faster! Faster! <i>Faster!</i>” screamed a voice in his
very ears. And if he tried to slow up ever so little,
“Rush! Rush! <i>Rush!</i>” the voice would command.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
<img src='images/i_127.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>“Faster! faster! <i>faster!</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Please, Uncle Wind—oh, please, Uncle Wind—I
can’t go any faster—my legs aren’t long enough!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Faster!</i>” screamed Uncle Wind in anger, prodding
poor Philippe so hard that he was fairly lifted off his
feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>Above them, and all around them, there was
the noise of tearing leaves and crashing branches,
there was the groaning of tortured trees as Uncle
Wind lashed them with his invisible cat-o’-ninetails.
Dim shadows streaked past like flying beasts.
“Rush!” shrieked Uncle Wind, “R-U-SHSHSHshshshshsh——”</p>

<p class='c012'>Something cold and stinging struck across Philippe’s
face, and it was then, in spite of his breathless panic at
the mad flight, that he wanted to burst out laughing,
for he saw that Grandfather, who had all this time
been running at his side, was going so fast that he was
actually losing his whiskers! “Your whiskers, Grandfather!
The wind is tearing your whiskers off!” But
the old man, who was speeding along more lightly
than any rabbit, paid no attention. In truth, it seemed
no great calamity, for as fast as Uncle Wind would
tear off his whiskers and his hair and scatter them on
the ground, new would grow immediately—and so
thick and fast they grew that the ground became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>covered with white. But whiskers were not cold and
wet when they brushed across one’s face: they
scratched and tickled, as Philippe had found out on
occasions when he had kissed Grandfather. This was
snow! Grandfather Snow was spreading his white
blanket over the earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>All night long Uncle Wind and Grandfather Snow
sped across the dark country like mad men, and when
little Philippe grew too tired to stand it any longer,
Uncle Wind would lift him up in his strong arms and
carry him. And the snow grew deep, and eddied and
twisted into great mounds and high drifts with sharp,
curved edges like the thin crests of waves—so that
in the cold, pale light of the coming morning,
the world looked like a beautiful dream cut from
marble.</p>

<p class='c012'>And with the coming of dawn, Uncle Wind suddenly
stopped driving them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was a great run!” said Uncle Wind. “It has
left me completely out of puff. Philippe, my boy, I
hope it hasn’t tired you too much? Grandfather Snow,
didn’t I drive you beautifully?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you have not done so badly. It will be some
days before we are in shape for another run like that.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Well, good-by! I think I shall do my famous vanishing
act again. How about you, Grandfather?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not quite yet. I shall linger on a bit. There are
a few touches, a few light touches I neglected in my
hurry last night that I would like to attend to this
morning. You see,” he explained to Philippe when
Uncle Wind had vanished, “I am quite an artist. Some
people think I am very little use and only good for
lying around. Not at all! I make excellent snowballs,
for one thing, and Uncle Wind is not the only member
of our family who has knocked a hat off! But of course
I would never tell you of such a thing if I did not know
that you were too much of a gentleman to use me for
such a purpose. No, no, my child, I work as hard
for the things that grow, in my own way, as Grandmother
Rain does in hers, but chiefly I delight to make
things beautiful. See that naked gray tree? How bare
and cold it looks! It needs a few high lights that I
could not stop to give it last night—” whereupon
Grandfather Snow touched each branch and twig with
a powdering from his white beard, and the twig and
branch of every tree around, until the whole world
above the level of the ground was a tracery of gleaming,
fairy lace. “Not bad, Philippe, not a bit bad! Can
you see anything else that needs touching up? Speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>out before it is too late, for my supply is nearly
exhausted.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_132.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Please, Grandfather, it is beautiful, but I am
cold and tired, and I would like to go where it is
warm.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course you would, my child. Look! Below us
in the valley it is green, and even from here one can
see that there are flowers. Run on down——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t want to run; I’m tired of running!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well,” laughed Grandfather, “walk then, if
you wish. After a while, when the warm sun comes
to view my handiwork, I, too, will slip down into the
valley, but I shall not stop there. No, I have a long
way to travel before I join Grandmother Rain once
more.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Philippe turned slowly away, touched by the purity
and peace that surrounded him. “Good-by....
Good-by&nbsp;...” said Grandfather Snow gently,
very, very gently!</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>As Philippe reached the green valley below, the sun
broke through a thin veil of silver clouds. It had risen
brilliant and white from its all night dip into the distant
ocean, and its cheering warmth was gratefully
received by the tired adventurer. A fragrance,
mingled of evergreens and flowers, herbs and damp
earth, filled the motionless air, and from the end of the
grass-grown lane, along which he walked lazily, there
was an amazing confusion of sounds, as if thousands of
birds were singing at one time. The lane led him to a
gate, and on the gate was a sign which said:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>PHILIPPE’S GARDEN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I must have been away a long time for my garden
to have grown so big,” Philippe told himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>Standing inside the gate was little Avril in a new
green smock prettily embroidered with wreaths and
garlands of flowers. She curtsied so low before him
that the hem of her dress brushed the young shoots of
grass; and she smiled at him tenderly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And who are you?” asked Philippe warily.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, Philippe! Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, I think I do; but I thought that I knew Grandmother
Marianne and she turned out to be Grandmother
Rain. Uncle Pablôt, it seems, was not Uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Pablôt at all, but Uncle Wind. And my Grandfather
Joseph is Grandfather Snow and lies just above us on
the hill. It is very puzzling; can I be sure that you
have not changed your name?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have quite a number of names,” explained the
little girl. “Some call me Spring, some call me Flora,
but you may call me Avril. Avril: April—it is all
the same. Would you like me to show you your
garden? It is very lovely, and I have worked hard to
get it all in readiness for your coming.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. I am your gardener, but I have had a lot of
help. Every one has been so kind! Uncle Wind
helped me plant it, Grandfather Snow prepared the
ground in fine shape, and Grandmother Rain has been
here often and often, giving my little plant babies their
bottles. It has been a lot of worry and care, Philippe,”
Avril told him in a curiously grown-up voice, “but
when you see my beautiful children, I am sure that
you will think that it was worth while.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now here,” she said, smiling happily and taking
him by the hand, “are some of my first babies: the snowdrops,
named in honor of their godfather, Grandfather
Snow. And here——”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>
<img src='images/i_135.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p>From flower to flower they wandered.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>From bed to bed, from border to border they
wandered, looking at the flowers, breathing the sweet
perfume, and watching the clumsy but clever bees, out
marketing for honey which they would pay for with
golden pollen dust carried on their velvet backs. There
were soft-petaled pansies as dark as midnight, as
purple as a queen’s dress, as yellow as the sun, and
sometimes of many colors curiously combined to form
impish and laughing faces. There were lilies of the
valley and violets, stonecrop and candytuft, peonies
and roses, larkspur and bridal wreath—so many flowers
that Philippe could not remember their names, but
gave himself up to the enjoyment of their soft and gorgeous
colors, their delicate and magnificent shapes.
Farther along the maze of paths where he was led by
Avril, the flowers were still furled in tight buds, and at
length they came to beds where the dark loam was
scarcely more than broken by lifting sprouts. “These
are for later,” explained his fairylike guide.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And these?” asked Philippe, when they had entered
into a new part of the garden where straight rows of
green-growing things were marked off in beds of
checkerboard design.</p>

<p class='c012'>“These funny little fellows,” Avril told him, “are
not as beautiful and proud as the flowers; they hold
their heads less high, but they are all extremely worthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and one would find it difficult to get along without
them.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They look good enough to eat,” said Philippe, who
was beginning to feel very empty.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are,” said Avril.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And is all this garden mine?” asked Philippe.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” answered the little girl, curtsying again before
him, and added: “All yours—King Philippe!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you mustn’t call me ‘King,’ that is, when we’re
not playing games, you know,” Philippe warned her,
rather shocked. “Kings are grand people with
treasures hidden away in strong chests, and they wear
crowns of gold and have thousands of servants. I
know, because I have read all about them in a book
which my mother gave to me. I am a farmer’s son,
and can never be so wonderful a person as a King.”</p>

<p class='c012'>His companion looked at him very thoughtfully, and
at last spoke:</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are a King, Philippe. Sun, Moon, and Stars
shine down upon your head a crown; the whole earth
is yours, the great strong chest of hidden treasures.
From the time the first small star hung like a lonely
spark in space, your servants have been preparing for
you a kingdom, the kingdom of Earth, than which
there is only one greater. And that kingdom, too, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>be yours some day if you rule wisely and well in this,
and are kind, and strong-and gentle.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It may be true,” said Philippe, rather bewildered
by the wonderful things he was hearing. “But I am
quite sure that I have no servants; why—little though
I am, even I must help my father in the fields.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are all your servants. Is it not true, Grandmother
Rain?”</p>

<p class='c012'>A shower suddenly passed over the garden, decking
the flowers in crystal splendor, and from a small cloud
overhead Philippe could distinctly hear the voice of
Grandmother: “Yes. I have worked for Philippe’s
father and his grandfathers from the very beginning
of things, and I hope to work for his children and his
childrens’ children for time evermore. Do not think
badly of me, Philippe, if I do not come and go just to
your liking, for I am very busy, with much important
work to attend to.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it not true, Grandfather Snow?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aye, so it is!” came a voice from the bright hill
beyond the garden wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it not true, Uncle Wind?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well! I am just in time,” remarked Uncle
Wind, sauntering up the garden path, the flowers
nodding to him as he passed. He had cast aside his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>great cloak, but even then looked a little warm. “Just
wandered up from the Southlands,” he continued.
“Yes, my little darling, it is true enough what you are
telling Philippe, but of course we are not to be bossed
about like ordinary servants; we serve and yet we keep
our independence; we have been at our various tasks so
long that we know exactly what to do without being
told, and if we seem a little lazy at times, or a little too
enthusiastic at others, remember that we may have our
own very good reasons. Yes, indeed,” he went on,
commencing to bluster a bit, “there are often reasons
hidden in the strangest things we do. Did I ever tell
you how once I mussed up the hair of a prince and ran
off with the parasol of a duchess——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The wind is capable of being a little monotonous at
times,” Avril whispered into Philippe’s ear, but he
could hardly hear her, for the garden was being filled
with other voices, coming from here, there, and everywhere—from
the grass, and the flowers, and the vegetables,
and the trees, from the stones, and even from the
brown earth itself, and they all were saying in their
own way, the one thing: “We serve!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please listen to us a moment,” pleaded the fragile
voices of the flowers. “We serve too, though many
consider us too delicate and concerned about our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>looks to be of much use. But do not forget us,
Philippe! Do not forget us when you are grown up
and your mind is crowded with worries and cares and
a lot of things that will seem more important to you
than they really are. Keep a place for us in your mind
and heart, and we will repay you in our mysterious way
a hundredfold and more. Do as we ask; treasure
beauty, purity, and truth—for though you may love
us now, you will not understand the full importance of
our message until you have grown up. Do not
forget——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The flowers are very talkative to-day,” remarked
one little lettuce to another.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The flattery of the bees has quite turned their
heads,” agreed a radish who was notably sharp, whereupon
some of the more sensitive flowers who had overheard
blushed deeply.</p>

<p class='c012'>But Philippe heard none of this chatter of the vegetables,
for it seemed that the whole world, the ox
and the ass, the horse and the cow, the tame beasts of
the fields and the wild beasts of the spaces beyond, the
fox and the rabbit, the mouse and the beetle, the
creatures that crawled and the creatures that ran, the
cricket and the grasshopper and the inhabitants of air
and ocean, the little hills and high hills, the valleys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and forests, the voice of water through the land, sky
and earth—all, <i>all</i> were joining in a great, droning
chant: “We serve—we serve—we serve——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What utter nonsense!” shouted a little bird saucily,
flying from the low branches of a tulip tree. “I serve
no one; I just have lots of fun, and I’m going to have
an exciting fly—and that’s something little boys can’t
do, for they haven’t even any pin feathers!”</p>

<p class='c012'>The cocky way the little bird flapped her wings and
tossed her head made Philippe double up with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c012'>“See!” said the little rebel’s mate, flying close. “You
have made the King laugh, so your empty boasting has
broken like a bubble, for laughter is one of the greatest
services in the world! And as for going on your wild
flight, have you forgotten our pretty blue eggs in their
soft brown nest?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am a King!” said Philippe in a daze of wonderment.
“My darling Avril, tell me what I can do to
show my gratitude to all my servants.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They love nothing better than that you use them,
Philippe. Use them wisely and well, and not only for
yourself—but for others.” And gentle Spring kissed
him upon the lips, filling his heart with love and
happiness.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“It is high time,” said Philippe’s mother to
Philippe’s father, “that our little one was back. Soon
it will be dark.”</p>

<p class='c012'>She went to the doorway and gazed across the fields.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here comes Pablôt,” she called back into the room,
“and he is carrying the child in his arms.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sh-h-h-h-h!” breathed Uncle Pablôt, drawing close.
“Take your son gently into your arms; he has been
sleeping bravely all the way from his grandparents’.
And here,” said Uncle Pablôt, “is his little silver
whistle, by which I hope that he will remember me
when he wakes up and finds me gone.”</p>
